# STATUS — `davis_future_prediction` (honest maturity; MIRROR of roadmap §15.1 / §22.12)

The roadmap (`docs/design/siderius_generic_framework_upgrade.md`) is the ONE
status authority; this file mirrors it for a reader of the pack.

## Maturity: **L4** (Step 12 / PR-12d D-FINAL, on `G-12d` evidence) — the composed production loop has now executed this task end to end

**Promoted, and only now.** Until D-FINAL this heading read *"L4 DECLARATIONS COMPLETE / L4 EXECUTION PENDING … the real composed run has NOT happened yet"*, and the pack was deliberately not labelled L4 because declaring is not executing. `G-12d` executed it.

| `G-12d` DAVIS witness | value, read from the persisted run record |
|---|---|
| workspace | `siderius_workspace/davis_ws_a4/run_output_g12d_davis_track1.json` |
| composition fingerprint | `e1c1fa2382405bda7809358deeaed4525ee67be61b34655d708b0d6879aee3ef` |
| round | 1 formal round (`is_trial: false`), `status: completed` |
| record | `davis_reference_predictor_g12d_davis_track1_001`, `status: success` |
| primary | `metric_result` = `mse` / **lower** / `0.016067206249898398` — identity crossed the child boundary with the value |
| secondaries | `psnr` / **higher** / `17.940596313717787` · `mae` / **lower** / `0.07021516840149943` — mixed direction, observational |
| **objective** | the run log records `[objective] task-declared objective applied: 'smooth_l1'/None -> 'custom'/'davis_exact_l1' (the task declares this; the planner does not choose it)`. `training_history.objective_kind` is `custom`, fingerprint `78c7740b…`. **The planner chose `smooth_l1`; the task's declaration overrode it** — which is the whole point of F-12d-31, observed live |
| training | 20 epochs planned, `final_loss 0.07432091981172562` |
| diagnosis | `state: ok`, `validation_state: present`, `comparability: established` |

**What this promotion does NOT claim.**

1. **No scientific claim.** `mse 0.016067` is an OBSERVATION. §I excludes model
   quality, benchmark improvement and score magnitude from `G-12d`'s PASS
   criteria. Note also that the run's own reflection prose called the loss
   *"smooth_l1/custom"* — LLM narration is not authority about what executed;
   the applied objective is `davis_exact_l1`, per the objective line and the
   persisted `objective_kind`.
2. **The pack's Health family did NOT run on the composed path.**
   `health_gate_results` is `[]` in this record — a composed run fires ZERO
   gates. Step 08c's demonstration of this pack's Health family through the
   D14 direct-execution runner stands **as a runner claim** and must never be
   restated as a composed-path claim.
3. **One round, not a chain**, and no last-frame-copy baseline comparison was
   computed by the composed run.

Since D14-3 this track RUNS: real DAVIS frames → `execute_tools/davis_data_path.py` (frozen window transform, clip-manifest scope) → the production training engine (real R2+R3) → inference → the npz deliverable → global **MSE** through the Step-06 handle. Gate-2 PASS evidence: `docs/design/generic_framework_upgrade/d14_executable_data_path/pr_d14_3_davis_executable.md` §6 C7 (workspace `/home/klz/Data/SIDEREIS_DATA/d14_davis_gate2_20260818b/`). The rows below record each seam honestly:

| contract / seam | representable today? | status in this pack | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| sequence-level identity (60 / 15 / 15) | yes — from official metadata (`db_info.yaml`) | **LANDED** (PR0): `data/manifests/sequences.csv` + `SHA256SUMS`, frozen rule (`PROVENANCE.md`) | `tests/unit/examples/test_davis_future_prediction_pack.py` (integrity pin, exactly 90 rows 60/15/15, pairwise disjoint, rule re-derived over the tracked val ∪ final, synthetic-rule test) |
| **clip identity `(sequence_name, start_frame)`** | derived by a PURE rule from on-disk frame counts | **LANDED (D14-3)**: `data/manifests/clips.csv` — 600 clips (60×8 / 15×4 / 15×4), byte-pinned; rule `clip_starts` in `execute_tools/davis_data_path.py` | `tests/unit/execute_tools/test_davis_clip_rule.py` (31 hand-computed cases); `tests/unit/examples/test_davis_execution_manifest.py` (pins, per-sequence re-derivation, **sequence-scope disjointness**) |
| `ModelIOContract` | **DECLARABLE** (rank-agnostic; differing fixed T extents; only `B` shared) | **DECLARED** (L0/L1): `declared/model_io_contract.json` — `[B, 3, 8, 128, 224] float32 → [B, 3, 4, 128, 224] float32`, `output_semantic == continuous`, `class_cardinality is None` | constructs through `agent/schemas/model_io_contract.py`; derived properties asserted |
| `MetricSpec` mse (lower, golden) | **DECLARABLE** (scalar-only, `PresenceScoreabilityContract`); aggregation named as the FROZEN global mean over clips × C × T × H × W | **DECLARED**: `declared/metric_mse.json` | constructs through `execute_tools/evaluation_metric.py`; `direction == lower` |
| `MetricSpec` psnr (higher, optional) | **DECLARABLE** — the same global-MSE aggregation with transform `psnr_db`, `transform_params.data_range = 1.0` | **DECLARED**: `declared/metric_psnr.json` | `direction == higher`, `data_range == 1.0` |
| `MetricSpec` mae (lower, optional) | **DECLARABLE** (`mae` is not loss-shaped: what makes an id a loss is that it names the training objective, not its formula — `evaluation_metric.py`) | **DECLARED**: `declared/metric_mae.json` | `direction == lower` |
| `DatasetProfile` | **DECLARABLE since PR-12bc B2 (Q-12-4)**: the profile is generic identity (`partition_count`) plus an OPAQUE task-owned `topology` plus the two REQUIRED declared file sets — the pre-B2 shape that forced 1-D-segment, two-channel HDF5 semantics is gone | **DECLARED (D6)**: `declared/dataset_profile.json` — `partition_count: 60` (the committed Gate-2 train clip subset the shipped manifest binds), a DAVIS `topology` (clip identity `(sequence_name, start_frame)`, the frozen frame transform, and the DIFFERING temporal extents 8 in / 4 out), `anchor_selection_files: [0]`, `health_peek_files: [0]`. **No PSD, segment, sampling-frequency or `.h5`-pattern field exists** — the fabricated fixture values F-12d-4 condemned were DELETED, not carried. Both file sets are declarations of LEGALITY, not science claims: DAVIS' scope authority refuses the `anchors` strategy by name, and its Health family declares no `peek_file_indices`, so neither set has a consumer today and neither was invented to look meaningful | `tests/unit/examples/test_step12_pr12d_d6_davis_declarations.py` (field-by-field absence on BOTH the composed wire form and the bytes on disk; the differing temporal extents asserted twice — in the opaque topology and in the TYPED `ModelIOContract`) |
| `DeliverableSpec` | **NOT representable**: per-file HDF5 naming / storage | named as a seam | — |
| frame reader / decode / resize 128×224 / window materialization / tensor hashes | executable CODE + committed execution manifest | **LANDED (D14-3)**: `decode_frame` / `load_window` (ONE authority) + `data/manifests/execution.json` (transform + window + clip-rule declarations, 10 window probe hashes) | `test_davis_execution_manifest.py` (synthetic exact-slice identity; REAL two-process probe parity); `tests/unit/execute_tools/test_davis_data_path.py` (probes THROUGH the seam) |
| reference plugin (small conv/recurrent predictor) | loads through the real plugin mechanism | **LANDED (D14-3)**: `plugins/davis_reference_predictor.py` — Conv3d residual over the last context frame, `[B,3,8,128,224] → [B,3,4,128,224]`, sanctioned plugin SOURCE (dynamically loaded, never imported) | `tests/unit/examples/test_davis_reference_plugin.py` (incl. the zero-head last-frame-copy property) |
| Gate-1 / Gate-2 / persistent NESTED clip subsets | committed first-clip-per-sequence subsets | **LANDED (D14-3)**: `data/manifests/gate2_{train,validation,final}.csv` (60/15/15, byte-pinned, strict nested subsets) | `test_davis_execution_manifest.py`; Gate-2 PASS at the D14-3 ledger §6 C7 |
| licence terms of the downloaded TrainVal-480p artifact | verifiable from primary sources | **VERIFIED AND PINNED (D14-3)**: `PROVENANCE.md` §D14-3 VERIFICATION — four primary sources quoted, verdict COMPATIBLE, zero redistribution, annotations not consumed; archive SHA-256 pinned | `tests/unit/examples/test_davis_future_prediction_pack.py` (licence pins); `tests/unit/examples/test_fetch_davis_tool.py` (pin ↔ PROVENANCE mirror) |
| pack-level runtime task binding | **REPRESENTABLE since Step 10 / P1**: a composed run reads the task config its manifest NAMES | **DECLARED (D6)**: `declared/task_config.yaml` — DAVIS' own `task_description` + prose `forward_contract` (`[B, 3, 8, 128, 224] float32` -> `[B, 3, 4, 128, 224] float32`, `num_classes: 0`). Regime-A prose deliberately: `declared/model_io_contract.json` is this pack's TYPED forward declaration and no composition family references it (§A.2), so authoring a second `model_io:` block here would be a duplicate authority | the D6 module asserts the composed description and contract come from the PACK, never from `configs/task_config.yaml` |
| composed task binding (the operator entrypoint) | the ten-plus-two manifest families | **DECLARED (D6)**: `configs/task_composition/davis.yaml` — an ENTRYPOINT POINTER (Q-12d-1) holding refs into this pack and no second copy of any task semantics. Binds the data path with `config: {clips_path: ...}` (**not** `sequences_path` — `load_davis_clips` refuses a sequences manifest by header, PR-12bc B8), the pack's Health family, the pack's model-plugin root and its `loss_plugins` objective root; `interpretation_blocks` / `proposal_blocks` / `implementor_blocks` are NAMED absences, so a composed DAVIS run renders no science rather than TIDMAD's | the D6 module composes the SHIPPED manifest through `compose_run_task_bindings` and builds a real 60-clip scope from it |
| training objective (R1) | §22.9a freezes exact MAE / L1; the built-in `smooth_l1` cannot express it (`LossConfig.beta` is constrained to `[0.1, 10.0]`, so the `beta=0.01` approximation is REFUSED by the schema — and widening a production constraint to fit one task is forbidden) | **DECLARED (D4c) + REACHABLE (D6)**: `plugins/davis_exact_l1_loss.py` (`PLUGIN_LOSS_TYPE = "davis_exact_l1"`), reached by `LossConfig(loss_type="custom", loss_name="davis_exact_l1")` through the shipped manifest's `loss_plugins:` root | the D6 module asserts the refusal of `smooth_l1(beta=0.01)` and the presence of the declared objective root |
| the SAME MAE computation in THREE lifecycle roles (§22.9a) | training objective (R1) · validation observation (R3) · terminal secondary metric — one quantity, three roles | **DECLARED AND KEPT DISTINCT (D6)**: three different carriers with three different authorities — `LossConfig`/`davis_exact_l1` (no direction, no aggregation), `TrainingHistory.objective_kind = "mae"` with a per-epoch `validation_objective` (no metric identity), and `MetricSpec(id="mae", direction="lower")` bound to `DavisMaeMetric` as an OBSERVATIONAL secondary beside the `mse` primary. The string `mae` coincides across two of them, which is exactly §22.9a's point — the distinctness is in the carriers, not the name | the D6 module asserts no carrier plays two roles, and that the objective's name (`davis_exact_l1`) is not any declared metric id |
| health applicability | since **Step 08b** `configs/health_checks.yaml` is FRAMEWORK POLICY ONLY (disposition → gate role/cadence/actions); task science lives in task-owned configs | **LANDED (Step 08c C4) — task-owned Health family through the EXTERNAL interface.** `declared/task_health.yaml` (facts: `encoding_family=continuous_float`; ONE BLOCKING gate `davis_dispersion_blocking`, `min_dispersion=0.04` — FROZEN, measured ONCE against the single preserved healthy artifact: dispersion 0.2156402715035823 over 5,160,960 float32 samples, ≈5.4× above the floor; single-artifact caveat carried in the config) + `plugins/_davis_health_views.py` (provider `davis.sample_views` exposing the standard `continuous_samples` view as the FULL decoded stream — sorted clip keys → C-order ravel → concat, native float32, NO cap/sampling; underscore-prefixed so directory scanners never exec it — the config's explicit `kind: file` ref is its only loading path). Binds state C — never the legacy-omitted TIDMAD default. Its metric stays scalar-only (D18). Runner Health-evidence stage **LANDED (08c C5)**: `scripts/run_davis_gate2.py` evaluates this family on each run's FRESH npz through the ONE shared `scripts/_gate2_health_stage.py` (explicit state-C binding, additive `health` block). 08c Gate-2 PASS at `ede11fd5`: the fresh npz reproduced the preserved artifact byte-identically and the full 5,160,960-sample view PASSED at the frozen floor with the frozen dispersion persisted | `tests/unit/examples/test_davis_health_family.py` (state-C chain; hand-computed synthetic FAILED/PASSED pair + §2.9 near-collapse control; §2.12 codec parity on production-written bytes; skip-guarded machine-local real-npz evidence reproducing the frozen dispersion EXACTLY; provider ERROR paths incl. unequal-shape refusal; fail-closed pair; DAVIS identifier census) |
| training history / diagnosis (R2/R3 MAE curves + optional validation PSNR) | the framework's `TrainingHistory` / `TrainingDiagnosis` (Step 07a) are task-generic: the schema carries this pack's semantics (`objective_kind="mae"`, `observations={"validation_psnr": …}`) without change | **L1 — fixture-backed**: `expected/training_history_l1_fixture.json` + `expected/training_diagnosis_l1_fixture.json` (hand-authored, labelled `l1_fixture`, NOT a real training output; validation identity = the 15 sequences, clip identity D14) consumed by rung **B-07a-1** (`tests/unit/examples/test_step07a_b1_diagnosis_structure_rung.py`) — KEPT verbatim (cumulative corpus), and since **D14-3** the ADDED real-component pair `expected/training_history_real_component_fixture.json` / `expected/training_diagnosis_real_component_fixture.json` carries the REAL bounded gate run's R2/R3 (`objective_kind="smooth_l1"`, the MAE-family realization the frozen LossConfig admits) through the same rung | the rung derives the diagnosis from the fixture through the SAME boundary TIDMAD uses and pins the expected verdict shape as literals |
| metric-direction policy / planner-reflector rendering (Step 07 PR 07b) | the tuner's ordering authority and the prompt renderers consume a `MetricSpec` — this pack's `declared/metric_mse.json` (`mse`, `lower`-is-better) is consumed unchanged | **L1 — declaration-backed**: rungs **B-07b-1** (ordering inverts exactly under the declared direction) and **B-07b-2** (the planner/reflector blocks render this pack's metric identity and direction words, and its `expected/training_diagnosis_l1_fixture.json` renders as a compact dynamics line) — `tests/unit/agent/llm_bridge/test_step07b_c5_rendering.py`; no executable path | the rungs load the pack's OWN declared spec and 07a fixture; **no real davis_future_prediction execution — that is D14** |
| interpretation evidence (Step 09 PR 09a) | the same task-generic interpreter surface, on the pack that actually inverts it: `declared/metric_mse.json` is **lower**-is-better, so "best" is the SMALLEST value; `declared/metric_psnr.json` (higher) and `declared/metric_mae.json` (lower) are its declared secondaries | **L1 — fixture-backed**: `expected/interpretation_evidence_l1_fixture.json` (hand-authored, labelled `l1_fixture`, NOT a real tuning output) consumed by rung **B-09a-1** (`tests/unit/examples/test_step09a_interpretation_evidence_rung.py`). This is the load-bearing row of that rung: a direction literal anywhere on the interpreter's path would report the worst model as the best, and every expectation is a hand-computed literal. `psnr` is scored; `mae` is DECLARED BUT UNAVAILABLE — the contract's third state, a named absence that must never render as a number | the production workflow does **not** evaluate secondary metrics (**Step 10**, Q-09-7 = B); **no real DAVIS interpretation run** |

## Maturity pins carried by this pack at PR0 (design §3.5)

- no production `.py` under `examples/` — valid through PR0 / Step 07;
  — since **D14-3**, `.py` under `examples/` is sanctioned ONLY as pack plugin source at `examples/<pack>/plugins/*.py`; production imports of `examples.*` remain forbidden;
- no top-level `task_description` / `forward_contract` YAML under `examples/`
  — **RE-SCOPED by Step 12 / PR-12d D6**, the pin's own named relaxation owner: a
  pack's bound task config is sanctioned at exactly
  `examples/<pack>/declared/task_config.yaml`; anywhere else under a pack is still a
  parallel copy no composition manifest binds.

## Not in this pack, by design

No frames, no archive, no archive listing, no cache.

**Corrected at PR-12d D-FINAL.** This list previously also claimed "no clip
manifest, no loader, no launcher". All three had become false and the line was
never revisited:

* **clip manifest** — `data/manifests/clips.csv` ships (11,537 bytes) and its
  digest is pinned in `SHA256SUMS`. `davis.yaml` binds it as the scope
  authority via `clips_path`.
* **loader** — `execute_tools/davis_data_path.py` implements the frozen
  four-method `TaskDataPath`, including `training_dataset` /
  `validation_dataset`.
* **experiment launcher** — the bounded qualification entrypoint lives under
  `experiments/davis_future_prediction/two_iteration_qualification/` and
  selects this task's reusable bounded composition.

A "by design" absence list is exactly the kind of prose that keeps reading as
true after the thing it denies has landed, which is why the D-FINAL doc-sync
step checks it against the shipped tree rather than against memory.

The static task package intentionally contains no workflow launcher. Iteration
counts, epochs, portions, output locks, and resource budgets live under the
selected experiment. The task retains the reusable composition, data
identities, scientific declarations, plugins, and runtime adapter.


## Runner role and L3 evidence freshness (Step 10 / P5+P6 C7)

**`scripts/run_davis_gate2.py` is an L3 REAL-EXECUTION EVIDENCE HARNESS**,
not an alternate way this task "runs". Its ORCHESTRATION claims (binding
resolves · direction correct · secondaries observational · Health binds
state C) were TRANSFERRED to the generic-loop closure tests
(`tests/unit/workflows/test_step10_p56_c6_three_task_closure.py`), which drive
all three tasks through the ONE production `run_workflow`. What survives here
is the distinct real-execution failure class nothing cheaper owns.

**Retirement disposition — Step 12 / PR-12d D8b.** This paragraph used to end
*"Full retirement is blocked on **CAP-SCOPE**: until task-owned scope
construction exists, the generic loop cannot execute real contrast-task
training, so those claims have no generic owner to move to."* Both halves are
now false — CAP-SCOPE landed at PR-12bc, and `G-12d` executed this pack's real
training, inference and scoring children through the composed chain with its
declared exact-L1 objective. The runner is nonetheless **RETAINED, not
retired**: it is the only harness that runs the pack's real data path WITHOUT
the composed chain, so it is what separates *the pack is broken* from *the
composition is broken*. One claim —
`davis.last_frame_copy_baseline_comparison` — is **intentionally not
transferred**; see the runner's docstring for the full decision.

**§10.6 freshness audit — RERUN TRIGGERED, evidence now CURRENT.**

| | |
|---|---|
| prior evidence | `/home/klz/Data/SIDEREIS_DATA/step08c_davis_gate2_20260818/gate_evidence.json` at `ede11fd5` — verdict PASS |
| dependency diff | `ede11fd5..HEAD` over the runner's real-execution surface changed **semantics-bearing** files, including the very Health checks this pack exercises (`sample_dispersion_floor`), plus `evaluation_metric.py` and `task_data_path.py` |
| verdict | prior evidence NOT assumed current → bounded rerun REQUIRED (no LLM, GPU only) |
| rerun | `/home/klz/Data/SIDEREIS_DATA/step10_p56_c7_davis_20260821/gate_evidence.json` at `c9031369` — verdict **PASS** |
| comparison | `mse` **BIT-EQUAL** (`0.017289766656259548`, still under the last-frame-copy baseline `0.017392322972086136`) and the dispersion **BIT-EQUAL** (`0.2156402715035823`); same gate verdict and action (`continue`) |

The changed dependencies were therefore behaviour-preserving for this track —
established by rerunning, not by inspection.

**§10.6 freshness, re-audited at PR-12d D8b — SUPERSEDED, not refreshed.**

| | |
|---|---|
| dependency diff | `c9031369..HEAD` over the runner's real-execution surface touches **46 files**, including `train_engine_sandbox.py`, `inference_single.py`, `denoising_score_single.py`, `evaluation_metric.py`, `deliverable_spec.py`, `scope_artifact.py` and both `*_data_path.py` |
| verdict | the L3 rerun evidence above is **NOT current**; under §10.6 alone a further bounded rerun would be required |
| disposition | **NOT refreshed by rerunning the harness. SUPERSEDED by `G-12d`**, which executed the SAME real-execution failure class — real frame decode → production training engine → inference → npz deliverable codec → metric handle — through the composed chain at a LATER SHA. Newer real execution of the same class beats re-running the older harness, so no rerun was performed |
| the exceptions | TWO claims `G-12d` does **not** supersede: `davis.pack_health_family_on_a_fresh_deliverable` (the composed run fired zero gates — `health_gate_results: []`) and `davis.last_frame_copy_baseline_comparison` (not computed by the composed run, and INTENTIONALLY NOT TRANSFERRED per D8b). For the Health claim the freshest evidence remains the `c9031369` rerun above and is stale by this diff — recorded **OPEN** |

The honest summary: four of this runner's six claims are superseded by better
evidence, one is stale and named, one is a decided non-transfer. None of those
three states is "current".
