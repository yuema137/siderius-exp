"""DAVIS 2017 future-frame prediction — the pack's OWN terminal metrics.

Step 12 / PR-12d D4c (ruling A2-b). `psnr` and `mae` were DECLARED and both
bound to :class:`~execute_tools.evaluation_metric.GlobalMseMetric`, which
computes neither. Composition accepted it because the only identity check
compared the declaration to itself (**F-12d-3**) — so a terminal report could
have read `psnr / HIGHER` while mean squared error executed. That is the
failure D4c's acceptance names explicitly as a FAIL, and it is why these exist.

Aggregation matches `mse`'s frozen rule: the EXACT global mean over every
element of every scored sample — sums and element counts accumulated across
samples, divided ONCE. Never a mean-of-means; with unequal clip sizes those
differ, and the declared aggregation says "over clips × C × T × H × W".

A truth sample with no prediction is a LOUD error, not a zero. A missing dense
prediction has no defensible numeric stand-in, and a partial deliverable that
scored anyway would flatter the model silently.
