"""DAVIS future-frame prediction's executable data path (D14-3; Track C).

OWNERSHIP. How DAVIS RGB frames become `[3,8,128,224]` context /
`[3,4,128,224]` target windows, and how predicted future tensors become the
persisted deliverable — the task-owned side of the D14-1 ``TaskDataPath``
seam. The TRANSFORM here is the ONE authority the execution-manifest
generator and the runtime reader share; the committed ``execution.json``
probe hashes keep that single authority honest.

FROZEN TRANSFORM (child design §2.3; task table §22.9a):

    decode: PIL.Image.open -> .convert("RGB")     (NO EXIF transpose)
    resize: DIRECT to (W=224, H=128), PIL BILINEAR — a declared small
            aspect distortion (854x480 = 1.779 -> 1.75), chosen over a crop
            so every pixel of the scene stays in frame
    values: float32 / 255.0, CHW; a window stacks 12 consecutive frames as
            context [3,8,128,224] (start..start+7) + target [3,4,128,224]
            (start+8..start+11)

Manifest parsing lives HERE, not in the pack tooling: production must never
import `tools.example_packs` (§22.23.9 separability — the D14-2 C7 lesson,
applied from the start).

BOUNDARIES (parent Amendment 2): codec only — the global-MSE metric and its
scoreability belong to the Step-06 authority.
