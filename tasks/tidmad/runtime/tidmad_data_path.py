"""TIDMAD's TaskDataPath implementation (D14-1 C2b).

OWNERSHIP. This module owns TIDMAD's executable data path: how training and
validation samples materialize from the HDF5 archives, and how model outputs
become the persisted ABRA deliverable / are read back for evaluation.
``TIDMADEpochDataset`` was MOVED VERBATIM here from
``execute_tools/train_engine_sandbox.py`` (D14-1 C2b; the engine re-exports
it, so every pre-existing import keeps resolving). Behaviour is pinned by the
committed pre-relocation manifest
``tests/unit/execute_tools/goldens/d14_tidmad_parity_manifest.json`` —
expected values are READ from that artifact, never recomputed.

BOUNDARIES (parent Amendment 2). Codec only: no metric arithmetic, no
scoreability thresholds, no objective semantics. The output path terminates
at the Step-06 evaluation authority — ``write_deliverable`` delegates to the
deliverable-spec naming/storage authorities and ``create_abra_file`` (imports,
not copies); ``read_evaluation_payload`` resolves the persisted deliverables
for the Step-06 handle and nothing more.

REGISTRATION. Importing this module registers the implementation under
``TIDMAD_COMPATIBILITY_ID`` (regime-A legacy resolution, child §4.2 row 1).
Until C3/C4 rewire the production call sites the registration is inert.

NOTE: no ``from __future__ import annotations`` here — under lazy annotations
ruff (UP037) would force de-quoting an annotation INSIDE the verbatim-moved
class block, breaking the C2b byte-parity guarantee. Eager annotations keep
the moved block byte-identical.

                            production campaign) loads the full selection.
            file_family:    Which file family of the Dataset Profile the
                            indices address — ``"training"`` (default; the
                            pre-07a behaviour, byte-for-byte) or

                            geometry, subsampling and row layout are shared.

        **Why an absolute ceiling exists beside ``train_portion``.** A
        fraction cannot bound the epoch, because what it is a fraction OF
        is not harness-owned: ``ml_segs_per_psd`` is
        ``psd_segment_length // seg_size`` and ``seg_size`` comes from the
        planner's model config, so 1 % of the scope at ``seg_size=1000``
        is ten times the samples it is at ``seg_size=10000``. During
        Step 03 a 1 %-portion plan resolved to 12,500 optimizer steps.

        Enforced by reading LESS, not by stopping later: files stop being
        opened once the budget is met, and the concatenated arrays are cut
        to exactly ``max_samples``. Both the HDF5 reads and the optimizer
        steps shrink, so the epoch is small rather than merely truncated —
        the whole point of bounding before execution instead of killing
        during it.
