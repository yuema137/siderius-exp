"""
Shared low-level scoring utilities for TIDMAD denoising evaluation.

Two layers:

1. LOW-LEVEL (PSD / SNR): atomic building blocks that compute PSD and SNR
   at the 1-second segment level. Used by the anchor map builder, the
   segment-aware scorer, and (indirectly) the legacy scoring path.

2. ANCHOR-NORMALIZED SCORING: score_segments() and score_vector() use a
   pre-computed anchor map (from build_anchor_map.py) for normalization
   instead of file-local normalization. This makes scores from trial mode
   (sparse sampling) directly comparable to formal mode (all 20 files).

3. AGGREGATION STANDARD: score_vector() returns a SINGLE canonical scalar
   per (model, scope) — the linear grand mean over EVERY sampled segment
   across every sampled file, then log_5.27:

       denoising_score = log_5.27( Σ_{f,i} per_segment[f,i] / Σ_f |S_f| )

   Equivalent for uniform per-file segment counts: log_5.27 of the mean
   of ``file_vector``. This is the ONE number reported per run.

   The following are NOT valid aggregations and MUST NOT be substituted:
     * mean of per-file log scores    — Jensen's inequality gap
     * mean of per-band log scores    — same reason
     * mean of per-band linear means  — silently reweights unequal
                                        partitions (e.g. 4/6/5/5)

   If a diagnostic breakdown is needed, expose the per-file linear vector
   ``file_vector`` unchanged, or call score_vector on a scoped SampleSet —
   never average pre-aggregated log scores. CLAUDE.md's "aggregate scalars
   are only comparable within one scope" enforces the same rule for
   cross-run comparison.

All functions operate on raw HDF5 data and are stateless.

LEGACY PARITY: every function here is a byte-strict transcription of the
reference implementation at ``/home/tidmad/TIDMAD/denoising_score_old.py``.
See ``docs/align_denoising_score.md`` for the full alignment contract. In
particular:

* scaling is applied in the time domain (``TS = data.astype(float32) * scaling``);
* the FFT is ``np.fft.rfft`` in ``complex128`` precision — enforced under
  numpy ≥ 2.0 by ``TS.astype(np.float64)`` immediately before ``rfft``, which
  restores the implicit float32→float64 promotion performed by numpy ≤ 1.x
  under which the canonical TIDMAD benchmark numbers were generated;
* the zero-noise trap in ``get_snr`` uses strict equality (``noise == 0``).

scipy.fft is prohibited here: it uses a different pocketfft backend with a
different butterfly ordering, and does not produce bit-identical output.

    Boundary DataScope invariant (docs/design/enable_partial_file_list.md):
    when ``scope`` is provided, every file index must lie inside it — this is

    (``NUM_FILES``, ``SEGMENTS_PER_FILE``, ``TIDMAD``), so every parent-side
    boundary check applied TIDMAD's 20x200 grid whatever task was bound: a
    run with 3 files silently accepted ``{19: [199]}``, and a run with 400
    segments per file had two thirds of its index space rejected. The bound
    now comes from the run's own profile, split exactly as Q-12-4 split the

    Skipping is the honest behaviour for the second bound, not a weakening: a
    task that declares no per-partition index space has no number to check
    against, and inventing TIDMAD's is precisely the defect being removed. The
    structural checks — dict, non-empty, integer keys, non-empty integer

    Score multiple files and return the length-``NUM_FILES`` per-file vector
    plus a scalar score aligned with the legacy TIDMAD formula.

    Two-phase design (see ``docs/align_denoising_score.md`` §B):

    1. Collect raw ``(snr_sg, snr_squid)`` pairs for every sampled segment
       across every sampled file, via ``_collect_raw_pairs``.
    2. Choose ``s_max`` per ``legacy_mode``, normalize, aggregate as the
       **grand mean** across all sampled segments, then take ``log_{5.27}``
       (no ``round(·, 2)`` and no ``+ 1e-10``; ``-inf`` when the grand mean <= 0).

    Args:
        data_dir:              Directory containing the denoised HDF5 files.
        sample_set:            ``{file_index: [segment_indices]}`` — which
                               segments to score per file.
        anchor_map:            The ``"anchors"`` dict from
                               ``segment_anchors.json``. Only read in
                               ``legacy_mode=False``. Accepted but unused
                               in ``legacy_mode=True``.
        s_max:                 Global maximum CH2 SNR. Required when
                               ``legacy_mode=False``; ignored when
                               ``legacy_mode=True`` (computed from the

                               ``np.amax`` of the current file list).
        denoised_filename_fn:  Callable ``(file_index) → filename`` that
                               resolves the denoised HDF5 for each file
                               index. Must be provided — there is no
                               default.
        raw_data_dir:          Directory containing the raw validation
                               files (``abra_validation_XXXX.h5``).
                               Defaults to ``data_dir`` when ``None``.
        parallel:              Use multiprocessing to collect across files
                               in parallel.
        num_workers:           Max parallel workers.
        legacy_mode:           When True, reproduces
                               ``denoising_score_old.calculateBenchmark``
                               bit-for-bit on ``sample_set`` (provided the
                               underlying primitives match — see Phase A).
                               The ``s_max`` used for normalization is
                               ``np.amax`` over the CURRENTLY sampled
                               ``snr_sg`` values, mirroring legacy's
                               file-list-local maximum. No anchor map is
                               consulted.
    Returns:
        (file_vector, final_scalar):
        - ``file_vector``: length-``NUM_FILES`` list. Entry ``f`` is the
          per-file weighted mean
          ``mean_i( snr_sg[f][i] / s_max_used * snr_squid[f][i] )`` for
          files in ``sample_set``, ``None`` otherwise.
        - ``final_scalar``: the score
          ``log_{5.27}(grand_mean)`` (``-inf`` when ``grand_mean <= 0``)
          where ``grand_mean = Σ_{f,i} (snr_sg/s_max_used · snr_squid)
          / Σ_f |S_f|``. For uniform ``|S_f|`` this equals the mean
          of ``file_vector`` entries; for non-uniform sampling the grand
          mean is the legacy-compatible aggregation. See the module
          docstring section 3 for the canonical aggregation contract —
          in particular, callers MUST NOT re-aggregate this scalar by
          averaging per-band or per-subset scores.

    Health-check separation (commit-5a): ``score_vector`` is pure
    scoring — no health-check code. The previous embedded Phase 0
    pre-FFT short-circuit and Phase 3 post-scoring panel were removed
    entirely per Option A in
    ``docs/design/pluggable_health_checks.md`` §14. Health checks now
    run tuner-side via ``evaluate_gate`` at round boundaries; see the
    tuner's post-``sandbox.score_vector()`` block (landed in commit-5b).
    ``reference_file_vector`` and ``degeneracy_threshold_ratio`` were
    removed from this signature — both were only consumed by the
    deleted magnitude-ratio predicate.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``denoised_filename_fn`` is None, or if
