# examples/oxford_iiit_pet/plugins/_pets_health_views.py
"""The Pets pack's Health view provider (Step 08c C3).

Registers through the SAME public interface an out-of-tree task uses —
imports only the health package's public surface, is loaded ONLY through
the pack's ``declared/task_health.yaml`` explicit ``kind: file`` ref, and
its content digest joins the pinned run identity.

Underscore-prefixed on purpose: both generic directory scanners (the ML
plugin loader and the Health directory-kind loader) skip ``_``-prefixed
members, so this module can never be executed as a side effect of a
wholesale ``plugins/`` scan — the explicit ref above is its only path in.

**Codec ownership honesty (§2.12).** This is a narrow pack-local
projection of the pack's OWN deliverable format (one CSV, header
``image_id,predicted_class_index``). The production reader is
task-owned ``runtime/pets_data_path.py``; the mandatory codec-parity regression
asserts both readers agree on the same bytes, so a format change cannot
leave one silently accepting a different artifact than the other.
