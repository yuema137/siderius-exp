Nothing else from the archive (trimaps, xmls) is used.

## Images artifact (fetched at D14-2 C1; bytes NEVER tracked — pins only)

| independent corroboration | archive MD5 `5c4f3ee8e5d25df40f4fd59a7f44e54c` equals torchvision's official `OxfordIIITPet` resource pin — a second authority in place of a second full fetch |
| members | 7 394 tar members; 7 390 `images/*.jpg` (+ a handful of stray `.mat` the official archive ships; ignored) |
| verify/extract tool | `tools/example_packs/fetch_oxford_iiit_pet.py` (pins are module constants — the executable authority; this table mirrors them). Re-fetching `annotations.tar.gz` through the tool on 2026-08-18 re-verified its PR0 pin byte-identically. |
| lifecycle | archives + extracted `images/` live in an operator-supplied MACHINE-LOCAL directory outside the tree (`data/README.md`); the framework receives the root as the data path seam's `data_dir` (D14-2 child design §2.1) |

## Identity manifests — FROZEN derivation rule (design §3.2, OD-PR0-2)

- `final` = the official `test.txt` list (3 669 images).
- `train` / `validation` = per class, sort the official `trainval.txt` image
  ids lexicographically; the entry at 0-based position `i` goes to
  `validation` iff `i % 5 == 4`, else `train`. **No RNG, no seed — the rule
  is the provenance.** Result: train 2 946 · validation 734 (= 3 680).
- Row: `image_id, class_index (0-based = official CLASS-ID − 1), official_class_id, scope`;
  rows sorted by `(class_index, image_id)` so regeneration is byte-deterministic.
- Implementation: `tools/example_packs/oxford_iiit_pet.py` (`split_trainval`,
  `derive_manifests`); the rule is re-tested on a synthetic list in
  `tests/unit/examples/test_oxford_iiit_pet_pack.py`, independent of the fetch.

## SHA-256 pins (`data/manifests/SHA256SUMS`)

```text
f72580dcec11a5234904bacc1f98b3119c72d7bc374b9691169723502477d070  final.csv
b58e8791460ab3d5b172e7a95d4841dd603db1ecbd38bf43dafcecec522546ea  train.csv

```

The pin is an **integrity / provenance pin**: it detects corruption and names
the exact bytes reviewed. It is NOT by itself an immutability proof (a
manifest and its pin can change together). What makes the identity canonical
is the frozen rule + the official source's recorded SHA-256 above + review of
any regeneration commit.

## Regeneration (explicit operator act)

```bash
curl -sSL -o /tmp/pets/annotations.tar.gz https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/data/annotations.tar.gz
sha256sum /tmp/pets/annotations.tar.gz      # must equal the archive SHA-256 above
tar -xzf /tmp/pets/annotations.tar.gz -C /tmp/pets annotations/trainval.txt annotations/test.txt
.venv/bin/python -m tasks.oxford_iiit_pet.tools.oxford_iiit_pet \
  --annotations-dir /tmp/pets/annotations
```

A regeneration that changes any manifest byte must be committed with its
reason and the new source SHA-256 recorded here.

## Health fixture-of-record (Step 08c C3)

`expected/d14_gate2_collapse_predictions.csv` is the REAL preserved D14
Gate-2 deliverable `predictions_pets_reference_cnn_d14p_pets_gate2_001.csv`
(byte-identical copy from
`/home/klz/Data/SIDEREIS_DATA/d14_pets_gate2_20260818/`, also preserved
byte-identical in `…20260818b/`):

- sha256 `cc8470267fbf5331827c7b641ac2ce8efb834b07441a31836084d4d417ff752c`
- size 6 812 bytes
- content: 370 predictions — 369× class 5, 1× class 33 (distinct 2 of 37,
  dominant fraction 369/370 = 0.9972972972972973)

It is the constant-prediction collapse D14 deliberately preserved as
Step-08 health evidence (accuracy 0.02702702702702703 = exactly chance).
Immutable evidence: `tests/unit/examples/test_pets_health_family.py` pins
the sha256 and size, so the fixture cannot silently drift.
