"""Arm symmetry check (#255 exposure determination — launch-blocking).

The two-arm prior-art experiment is valid only if the arms differ in
NOTHING but the declared arm policy. The #255 exposure determination
CONDITIONS launch validity on exactly that, naming the lock-invisible
population knobs (``formal_portion`` / ``formal_train_portion`` /
``formal_eval_portion``) whose asymmetry would silently break arm
comparability without ever touching the invariants lock.

This checker is mechanical. ``campaign_preflight.sh`` captures the band
launcher's ``--dry-run`` output for BOTH arms with otherwise identical
arguments; this script parses each capture at two layers and diffs them:

1. the resolved launch configuration JSON
   (``run_one_iteration.py --print_resolved_launch_config`` — the policy
   fields), and
2. the exact child argv run_chain.sh would exec
   (``[DRY-RUN] would exec`` — where the population knobs actually live:
   the resolved-config JSON does NOT carry ``formal_*`` portions, data
   dir/scope, time budgets or VRAM budgets, so only the argv layer can
   prove them symmetric).

F-SCANG-4 (release blocker) added the third layer, because the first two
are both argv:

3. the ARM SURFACE artifacts (``campaign_arm_surface.py``) — RENDERED
   PROMPT BYTES, the ENVIRONMENT and the MACHINE-LOCAL STORES. The frozen
   row's finding is that layers 1-2 compare "two HYPOTHETICAL COMMAND
   LINES on ONE MACHINE, and every route that actually differs between two
   pods — home-directory stores, environment variables, rendered prompt
   BYTES — is outside what it can see". Layer 3 is REQUIRED, not optional:
   a surface argument the preflight forgets to pass would restore an
   argv-only gate wearing the name of a symmetry gate, which is exactly
   what the row describes.

   Prompt bytes are compared in two states. The NEUTRAL render (both arms
   at ``baseline_isolation=False``) must be byte-identical — it holds the
   treatment constant, so any difference there came from the machine. The
   ARM render must differ on the declared treatment surfaces — two arms
   that render identical prompts are mis-wired, not symmetric.

N-6 (release blocker) added the ATTRIBUTION rule, because layer 3 was
labelling evidence it never verified:

   the label must not claim more than the comparison established.

Two things follow, and both are enforced here rather than by the caller.

*The strength of a sibling surface is DERIVED, never asserted.* The
preflight used to set ``provenance=published`` on ``[ -f <path> ]`` alone,
and the artifact carried no captured-at, no host and no revision for any
reader to check. One same-host rehearsal — or a day-1 publication, which
survives every cold start because the cold-start row globs band workspaces
and never the campaign root — therefore earned the strongest label the
report can print, while the honesty disclaimer was printed ONLY in the
weaker ``local`` state and so DISAPPEARED exactly as the claim strengthened.
Schema v2 makes ``provenance`` required, :func:`classify_comparison` reads
it, and the caller supplies only the one fact it cannot be wrong about:
WHERE it read the file (``--sibling-source``).

*A layer that cannot differ is reported NOT COMPARED, never as agreeing.*
``capture_environment`` and ``resolve_stores`` take no arm argument, so when
both surfaces come from ONE host their environment and machine-local-store
sections are equal BY CONSTRUCTION — as is the NEUTRAL prompt render, whose
whole job is to detect machine-local contamination. The row nonetheless
reported "environment and machine-local stores agree". Those three layers
are now scoped: a DIFFERENCE is still a violation in every state (a
difference can only be a true positive), but AGREEMENT is reported as
evidence only when the two surfaces were captured on different hosts. The
ARM render is arm-comparable on one host — it tests the treatment wiring,
not the machine — and stays COMPARED always, as do the two argv layers.

Fields that may legitimately differ are the EXPLICIT allowlists below
(#255: arm label, lit-review enable/config — the root-paper variant
rides the lit-review config sha — and baseline isolation, plus the
arm-DERIVED workspace/run_name naming, which is asserted to match its
exact derivation rather than waved through). Every other difference is a
failure, printed field by field. The expected asymmetries are ALSO
asserted — two arms that resolve identically are mis-wired, not
symmetric.

Output-type pin: NO operator knob exists on the un-composed path (S9
audit: ``ProposalOutput.output_type`` is LLM-authored,
``agent/schemas/proposal.py:1120``; no ``WorkflowLaunchConfig`` field, no
chain flag). The check therefore asserts NEITHER argv carries an
output-type token, so a future asymmetric injection fails here.

Exit 0 = symmetric (report printed); exit 1 = violation (field-by-field
diff printed); exit 2 = a capture or surface could not be parsed.
