"""GPU-C co-residency probe — the per-leg training driver + result assembler.

Part of the arXiv launch-topology calibration (author ruling 2026-08-25):
the H100 campaign runs FOUR co-resident band chains per card, and every
watchdog / time-budget setting carries a 4-way co-residency factor that
must be MEASURED on the campaign card (the 1.85-2.13x pairwise RTX 5090
figure is a stale lower bound). ``gpu_c_coresidency_probe.sh`` is the
orchestrator; this file is its two mechanical halves:

``leg``
    Run ONE minimal REAL training workload on one band and time it. This
    is deliberately the zero-LLM half of ``scripts/run_comparison.py``'s
    Phase 1 baseline-trial path (``run_baseline_trial``): the paper-spec
    config from ``ml_models/legacy_baseline_configs.json``, ``epochs=1``,
    a snapshot SampleSet over the band's DataScope, executed through the
    REAL ``TidmadSandbox.execute_training`` subprocess on real TIDMAD
    data. No LLM, no inference, no scoring — the probe is resource
    calibration, and scores are explicitly out of scope. A background
    thread samples the leg's own process tree every few seconds and
    records the peak host anon-RSS (VmRSS sum) and peak device memory
    (``nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps`` rows owned by the tree).

``assemble``
    Read the solo-leg and quad-leg JSONs plus the orchestrator's host
    MemAvailable samples and write ``gpu_c_probe_result.json`` — per-leg
    wall times, the derived 4-way ``coresidency_factor`` (quad wall of
    the MATCHED band divided by its solo wall, so different band sizes
    never skew the ratio), per-chain VRAM peaks and host-RAM evidence —
    plus a human summary on stdout. The factor is what the operator
    copies into ``h100_posture.env`` (``H100_CORESIDENCY_FACTOR``) with
    a posture version bump.

Portability: the repository root is derived from this file's location
(never hardcoded), so the driver runs from any checkout path.
