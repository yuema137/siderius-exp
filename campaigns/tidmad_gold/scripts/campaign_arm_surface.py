"""Arm SURFACE capture — the three routes argv symmetry cannot see (F-SCANG-4).

``campaign_arm_symmetry.py`` compares two hypothetical command lines. The
frozen row records why that is not enough:

    the launch gate compares two HYPOTHETICAL COMMAND LINES on ONE MACHINE,
    and every route that actually differs between two pods — home-directory
    stores, environment variables, rendered prompt BYTES — is outside what
    it can see.

This module captures those three routes for ONE arm, on the host that will
run that arm, into a JSON artifact. ``campaign_arm_symmetry.py`` compares
two such artifacts. Publishing the artifact into the shared campaign
workspace root is what makes the comparison CROSS-POD: the second pod's
preflight reads the first pod's published surface instead of re-deriving a
sibling from its own state, which would agree with itself by construction.

Three sections, one per clause of the requirement:

1. ``prompt_bytes`` — what the model actually receives, not what argv
   promises. Every surface is produced by CALLING the production renderer
   (``render_available_models`` / ``render_available_losses`` /
   ``load_stage_prompt`` / ``get_task_description`` /
   ``render_forward_contract`` / ``resolve_run_proposal_blocks``), never by
   re-implementing it here — a second renderer would be free to drift from
   the one the run obeys, and then the gate would certify bytes nobody
   sends.

   Each surface is captured TWICE: once at the ARM's own
   ``baseline_isolation`` and once at a NEUTRAL ``baseline_isolation=False``
   shared by both arms. The neutral render is the contamination detector —
   it holds every machine-local input (the capability store, the task
   config, the templates) with the treatment held constant, so a difference
   between arms can only come from the machine. The arm render is where the
   treatment must SHOW: two arms whose arm renders are byte-identical are
   mis-wired, not symmetric.

   What this does NOT capture, stated so the launch packet cannot overclaim:
   the run-time evidence blocks (accumulated records, expert context,
   previous failures, hardware context) do not exist before iteration 1 and
   are left as literal ``{placeholder}`` tokens. This is the cold-start
   prompt surface, which is exactly the surface a preflight can speak for.

2. ``environment`` — every variable under a DECLARED prefix, plus a
   DECLARED explicit list. Secret-shaped names record presence only, never
   a value.

3. ``machine_local_stores`` — content digests of the home-directory and
   checkout-local stores that reach a run. Digests are computed over paths
   RELATIVE to each store root, so the same store mounted at two absolute
   paths on two pods digests identically; an absolute path never enters the
   hash.

4. ``provenance`` (N-6) — WHO captured this surface, WHEN, and from WHICH
   CODE. Without it the artifact is unattributable, and a reader that
   cannot attribute it cannot honestly call it cross-pod evidence: the
   preflight used to label a sibling surface ``published`` on FILE
   EXISTENCE alone, so one same-host rehearsal — or a day-1 publication
   surviving every later cold start, since the cold-start row globs band
   workspaces and never the campaign root — earned the strongest label the
   report can print. The label must not claim more than the comparison
   established, so the strength is DERIVED from these fields by
   ``campaign_arm_symmetry.py`` and is not a caller's assertion.

Writes JSON to ``--out``. Nothing is printed to stdout on success:
importing the framework emits plugin-loader chatter, and a caller parsing
stdout would parse that too.

#: that reintroduces a source overlay must be visible and cannot differ between
#: arms. Current preflight removes it before framework children execute. Root
#: normalization remains for old or independently captured surfaces: checkout
#: identity is compared through the recorded revision, while another injected

#: within it (N-9). A ``.pyc`` is DERIVED from a ``.py`` that is already in
#: the digest, and under Python's default timestamp invalidation its header
#: embeds the SOURCE MTIME — which is host-local. Two pods holding an
#: identical store therefore digest differently as soon as either has
#: imported from it, so hashing bytecode makes the store layer red for a
#: reason that is not a content difference. Excluding it removes no
#: detection: a plugin whose SOURCE differs still moves the digest.
