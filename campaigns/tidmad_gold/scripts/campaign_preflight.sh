# SIDERIUS campaign preflight (arXiv launch topology, H100 band fleet)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Role   : ONE launch-blocking gate for a band-fleet campaign launch. Every
#          row prints PASS/FAIL/SKIP/INFO with its evidence; ANY FAIL exits
#          non-zero. Run it on the campaign host, per arm, before
#          launch_band_fleet.sh (X9 arms) or run_gold_campaign.sh (campaign
#          arms).
#
# Arms — TWO launch topologies share this preflight:
#   x9    with-prior-art | without-prior-art. The #255 prior-art contrast
#         fleet: launch_band_fleet.sh -> launch_prior_baseline_experiment.sh,
#         FOUR CO-RESIDENT band chains on ONE card (h100_posture.env v3).
#   gold  goldpod | blindpod. The official campaign: run_gold_campaign.sh ->
#         stage1_search.sh -> stage1_run_band.sh, EXCLUSIVE_SINGLE_BAND
#         residency, ONE selected scientific band per device. A four-host
#         deployment selects one band per host and uses local device 0; the
#         one-host fallback keeps the historical devices 0..3.
#
#   X9 uses "{root}/{arm}_band{band}". Gold uses the campaign-qualified
#   "{root}/{arm}_{campaign_id}_band{band}". The workspace authority below
#   resolves the correct shape before the cold-start or resume check. Rows
#   that INVOKE the X9 launcher
#   (R6, R7) or that check the X9 CO-RESIDENCY posture (R4) do not describe
#   the campaign topology: under a gold arm they are SKIPPED BY NAME and
#   never reported as PASS. The gold launcher's own refusals point HERE for
#   the mount and library checks (_gold_campaign_lib.sh:326 for R1c,
#   :626 for R1), so those rows must be reachable with --arm goldpod.
#
#   Gold and Blind share every machine, staging, identity, and state check.
#   The arm authority requires advice for Gold and refuses advice bytes or an
#   inherited advice identity for Blind. R7 remains an X9-only comparison.
#
# Rows:
#   R1  workspace root exists / writable / on a PERSISTENT mount.
#       Expectation: the filesystem holding the root must survive pod
#       loss — records/checkpoints/manifests/provenance live there. The
#       check reads the mount's fstype (findmnt, df -PT fallback) and
#       FAILS on tmpfs/ramfs/overlay (pod-local ephemeral state); network
#       or block filesystems (nfs*, lustre, ext4, xfs, ...) pass.
#   R1b calibration store on a PERSISTENT mount (H100-prep finding,
#       2026-08-25; same fstype logic as R1). $SIDERIUS_CALIBRATION_DIR
#       (default ~/.siderius) holds the learned time-calibration k-tables
#       and the measured runtime-profile overlay (#311) — on a pod, ~ is
#       typically the ephemeral container overlay, so pod loss would
#       silently destroy the very artifacts H100 qualification produces.
#       Converts R8's former RETAIN-by-design assumption into a check.
#   R1d optional caller-owned free-space threshold. Capacity is measured by
#       preflight, while deployment supplies the GiB requirement because
#       qualification, Stage 1, and Stage 3 retain different volumes.
#   R1c generated-capability library root DECLARED and on a PERSISTENT
#       mount (F-GENLIB-WIRE-1; same fstype logic as R1/R1b). The root is
#       resolved by CALLING the production authority
#       (`core.generated_library.resolve_generated_library`) rather than
#       re-deriving it here, so this check can never drift from what the
#       run actually uses. It FAILS when the resolution reports
#       source="default" — i.e. $SIDERIUS_GENERATED_LIBRARY_DIR was not
#       exported — because the default ~/.siderius/generated_library is
#       the ephemeral container overlay on a pod AND is shared across
#       campaigns, so promoted capabilities from one campaign leak into
#       the next arm's proposer surface. R8 cannot see this: it globs the
#       CHECKOUT dir only and is blind to this root, which is exactly how
#       the contamination went unnoticed.
#   R2  authoritative code revision: `git rev-parse HEAD` printed
#       (launch-packet row `repo_sha=`), compared against --revision
#       (prefix >= 7 chars accepted); a DIRTY tree FAILS — commit first,
#       a campaign must be attributable to one SHA.
#   R2b import resolution: a neutral-cwd probe proves the PINNED
#       (PYTHONPATH=this tree) child resolves hyperparam_tuning inside this
#       tree with the #299-tolerant loss_history, and reports what an
#       UNPINNED child would resolve (the editable-install E1 trap).
#   R3  selected-band staging integrity: both raw HDF5 splits for the target
#       band, the scoring ruler, and exact Q3 checksums under explicit
#       --data_dir. Other bands need not be staged on a single-band host.
#   R4  X9 ARMS ONLY. Posture arithmetic (sourced from h100_posture.env):
#       chains x per-chain VRAM + min headroom must fit the card total
#       (pure function, unit-tested); and H100_CORESIDENCY_FACTOR must be
#       FILLED (empty predicts the band launcher's refusal — run
#       gpu_c_coresidency_probe.sh first). Both halves describe FOUR
#       CO-RESIDENT chains on one card; the campaign runs one chain per
#       card and its launcher never reads h100_posture.env, so under a gold
#       arm this row is SKIPPED rather than asserted about a posture the
#       campaign does not adopt. Gold does not require the X9 posture file.
#   R5  X9 host-RAM headroom. It is skipped for a selected single-band Gold
#       host because its only calibrated threshold describes four co-resident
#       X9 chains and must not be presented as a Gold measurement.
#   R6  X9 ARMS ONLY. arm+band identity coherence: the band launcher's --dry-run for
#       EVERY band of --arm resolves rc=0 with the expected
#       experiment_arm, derived run_name, and the DS8 pair
#       (--data_scope band + --health_gate_files <band files>) on the
#       child argv. It executes launch_prior_baseline_experiment.sh, which
#       is not the campaign's launcher; SKIPPED under a gold arm.
#   R7  X9 ARMS ONLY. arm symmetry (#255 exposure determination — launch validity
#       is CONDITIONED on it), in THREE layers:
#         argv  — both arms' dry-runs with otherwise identical arguments may
#                 differ ONLY in declared arm policy + derived naming;
#                 especially the lock-invisible population knobs
#                 (formal_portion / formal_train_portion /
#                 formal_eval_portion), --data_dir, band/scope, time
#                 budgets, VRAM budgets and the output-type surface must be
#                 IDENTICAL.
#         surface (F-SCANG-4, release blocker) — the RENDERED PROMPT BYTES,
#                 the ENVIRONMENT and the MACHINE-LOCAL STORES, captured by
#                 campaign_arm_surface.py through the production renderers.
#                 The first two layers are both argv, and the frozen row's
#                 finding is that "every route that actually differs between
#                 two pods — home-directory stores, environment variables,
#                 rendered prompt BYTES — is outside what it can see".
#                 Prompt bytes are compared in two states: the NEUTRAL render
#                 (both arms at baseline_isolation=false) must be
#                 byte-identical, since with the treatment held constant only
#                 machine-local state can move it; the ARM render must differ
#                 on the declared treatment surfaces.
#       This arm's surface is PUBLISHED to
#       {workspace-root}/.campaign_arm_surface_{arm}.json; the sibling arm's
#       published surface is used when it is there, otherwise the sibling is
#       captured on this host.
#
#       N-6 — THE LABEL MAY NOT CLAIM MORE THAN THE COMPARISON ESTABLISHED.
#       This script reports only WHERE it read the sibling surface
#       (--sibling-source published|local, a fact it cannot be wrong about);
#       what that file is WORTH is DERIVED by campaign_arm_symmetry.py from
#       the surface's own recorded host, code revision and captured-at
#       (schema v2 — a surface without them is REFUSED, exit 2). The derived
#       evidence state is one of cross_pod_verified / cross_pod_stale /
#       same_host / revision_mismatch / unverifiable, and R7 prints a caveat
#       in EVERY one of them — the weaker states louder than the verified
#       state, never the reverse. Previously "published" was asserted on file
#       existence alone and the disclaimer was printed ONLY in the local
#       state, so one same-host rehearsal (or a day-1 publication, which no
#       cold start removes: R8 globs the per-band workspaces, never the
#       campaign root) both upgraded the label and deleted the warning.
#
#       And a layer that CANNOT differ is reported NOT COMPARED, never as
#       agreeing: capture_environment() and resolve_stores() take no arm
#       argument, so on one host the environment, the machine-local stores
#       and the NEUTRAL prompt render are equal by construction. A DIFFERENCE
#       in those layers is still a violation in every state — scoping
#       withholds the claim that agreement proves something; it never
#       silences a difference. The ARM prompt render and both argv layers
#       test the treatment wiring, not the machine, and stay COMPARED always.
#       Field-by-field diff on failure (campaign_arm_symmetry.py; both arms
#       run from THIS checkout, so the SHA of R2 covers both). SKIPPED under
#       a gold arm: the checker's arms ARE the X9 pair and it positively
#       requires the lit-review split the campaign freezes OFF in both of its
#       arms, so it cannot be repointed at the campaign without a redesign
#       this script does not own.
#   R8  cold-start preconditions (#260 checklist, gate_testing_standard.md):
#       item 1 per-band workspaces absent/empty — resolved through
#       preflight_band_workspace for the arm ACTUALLY under check, so a
#       gold preflight inspects goldpod_v015_band<band> and can never report a
#       cleanliness verdict about a different arm's directory; item 3
#       agent_generated/models/*.py + _capability_index.json absent;
#       items 4 (workspace plugins/) covered by item 1; items 2/7
#       (seeds, advice) enforced by launcher refusals — stated per arm,
#       because the campaign's advice file is goldpod's DECLARED treatment
#       (_gold_campaign_lib.sh:511) and not a contaminant; items 5/6
#       (root-paper cache, runtime calibration) RETAIN by design — INFO.
#       --resume replaces the empty-workspace rule with campaign/arm
#       attribution, run-state integrity checks, and a next-iteration report.
#   R9  LLM reachability + concurrency smoke (campaign_llm_smoke.py):
#       a bounded burst of 8 parallel one-word completions through the
#       repo's own config loading; success count + p95 latency. NOT a
#       quota guarantee (provider-side limits act on the sustained
#       pattern) — skip with --skip_llm_smoke for offline rehearsals.
#
# Usage (campaign host):
#   bash campaigns/tidmad_gold/scripts/campaign_preflight.sh \
#       --workspace-root /persist/siderius_campaign \
#       --arm with-prior-art|without-prior-art|goldpod|blindpod \
#       --revision <expected sha> \
#       [--data_dir DIR] [--only BAND] [--resume] \
#       [--minimum-free-gib N] [--llm_config FILE] [--skip_llm_smoke] \
#       [--gold_advice_file FILE] [--gold_advice_sha256 SHA256] \
#       [--symmetry-band 0-3] \
#       -- --healthgate_mode blocking --result_authority scientific \
#          [more chain flags the real launch will pass...]
#
#   Everything after `--` is forwarded VERBATIM to every dry-run (both
#   arms identically), so R6/R7 validate the launch you will actually
#   perform; --healthgate_mode + --result_authority are REQUIRED there
#   (run_one_iteration.py refuses a formal launch without them).
#   Dry-runs import the full framework: expect ~1-5 min total.
#
#   Under --arm goldpod R6/R7 do not run, so nothing after `--` reaches a
#   dry-run and the whole preflight is fast; --healthgate_mode and
#   --result_authority are still REQUIRED, so one habit answers for both
#   topologies and a campaign operator cannot omit the flags whose absence
#   run_one_iteration.py refuses a formal launch over. --symmetry-band is
#   likewise accepted and unused there.
