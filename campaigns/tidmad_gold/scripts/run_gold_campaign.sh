# SIDERIUS Gold campaign — CANONICAL ENTRYPOINT (D-ARCH-1; exec, do not source)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Role   : the ONE thin campaign launcher. Binds the frozen authorities at
#          the shared boundary (_gold_campaign_lib.sh), records the resolved
#          launch manifest, and DISPATCHES to the stage orchestrators. It
#          implements NO scientific workflow: the iteration unit is the
#          existing chain (run_chain.sh -> run_one_iteration.py), reused
#          unchanged.
#
# Hierarchy (v19/v20 style, not a monolith):
#   run_gold_campaign.sh                     this file — bind + dispatch
#     stage1_search.sh                       four bands, one GPU each
#       stage1_run_band.sh                   persisted-state band loop
#         run_chain.sh / _chain_common.sh    EXISTING iteration execution
#     stage2_strict_retrain.sh               4 designs x 4 bands = 16 units
#         run_chain.sh (--validation_fixed_candidate_plan seam)
#
# NOT this launcher: launch_prior_baseline_experiment.sh (X9's experiment —
# its arms are with/without-prior-art and it refuses advice BY DESIGN; it
# stays untouched for X9 reproducibility, operator ruling D-ARCH-1/F-LAUNCH-2).
#
# Usage:
#   bash campaigns/tidmad_gold/scripts/run_gold_campaign.sh \
#       --siderius-checkout DIR \
#       --workspace_root DIR --stage 1 \
#       --gold_advice_file ADVICE.json \
#       [--arm goldpod|blindpod] [--task_config PATH] \
#       [--fcnet_reference_json PATH] [--only 0-3,4-9] \
#       [--gold_required_runtime_profile_path ABS_PATH \
#        --gold_required_runtime_profile KEY \
#        --gold_required_runtime_profile_sha256 HEX] \
#       [--gold_trial_vram_budget_gb V --gold_formal_vram_budget_gb V] \
#       [--stagger-seconds S] [--dry-run] [passthrough run_chain.sh flags...]
#
#   bash sdsc_submission_scripts/run_gold_campaign.sh \
#       --workspace_root DIR --stage 2 --design_registry DIR \
#       --gold_advice_file ADVICE.json [--dry-run] [...]
#
# Frozen bindings (see _gold_campaign_lib.sh for the table + decisions):
#   * the nineteen chain-boundary values, typed, never defaulted;
#   * --llm_config config/llm_routing.json, resolved from this campaign package
#     to an absolute path and
#     emitted on EVERY stage-1 band and stage-2 unit argv (D-LLM-1); an
#     unavailable file REFUSES the launch, because omitting the flag does
#     NOT fail — it silently routes every LLM role to run_one_iteration.py's
#     deprecated gemini-3.1-pro-preview default (F-LLM-WIRE-1);
#   * arm label goldpod|blindpod (X9 labels refused; R-ARM-STAMP-1);
#   * lit-review EXPLICITLY ON in both arms (D-LIT-ON-1, symmetric; supersedes
#     Q-LIT-1 = OFF). Config = the shipped configs/lit_review_config.yaml,
#     which IS the V19 configuration: V19 passed the bare flag and no config
#     path (the chain has no --ml_lit_review_config parse rule);
#   * the treatment boundary: --gold_advice_file -> --advice (goldpod only);
#   * band->GPU map 0-3->0, 4-9->1, 10-14->2, 15-19->3 (single_resident);
#   * R-RETENTION-1: --no-cleanup_denoised always; --cleanup_denoised refused.
#
# OPERATOR-SUPPLIED (not frozen) — the required runtime-profile binding
# (F-PROFILE-WIRE-1):
#   --gold_required_runtime_profile_path ABS_PATH (which artifact),
#   --gold_required_runtime_profile KEY ('<gpu_slug>/<regime>') and
#   --gold_required_runtime_profile_sha256 HEX (64 lowercase hex) together
#   make every stage-1 band and stage-2 unit require that exact artifact:
#   resolution is fail-closed and REFUSES on a wrong device/regime, a missing
#   artifact, or a digest mismatch. The PATH is declared, never derived —
#   with only a key and a digest the artifact was still LOCATED by ordinary
#   discovery, so a file was consumed because the calibration directory
#   happened to hold one of that name; a declared path is read and nothing
#   else is consulted, and a missing declared artifact refuses even where
#   discovery WOULD have certified. The VALUES are not frozen here because
#   the measured artifact is post-tag qualification data — its sha256 cannot
#   exist in tagged code, and editing a frozen constant on the pod would be
#   the tagged-code change that must FAIL M4 rather than be papered over.
#   Supply all three flags or none: a partial declaration is REFUSED, and
#   malformed values (a non-absolute path, a bad key shape, a short digest)
#   are refused at this boundary before any band is forked. Undeclared is the
#   legacy ladder (measured > shipped > uncalibrated) with byte-identical
#   child argv, and is PRINTED as '(none - ...)' rather than left silent.
#   Consumption is observable per chain: the resolved provenance reads
#   'bound:<path>#sha256=<hex>', recording the digest OBSERVED from the bytes
#   read rather than an echo of the declared one. The chain-level spellings
#   (--required_runtime_profile[_path|_sha256]) are RESERVED passthrough.
#
# OPERATOR-SUPPLIED (not frozen) — the per-mode VRAM ceiling (D-HW-6):
#   --gold_trial_vram_budget_gb V and --gold_formal_vram_budget_gb V forward
#   VERBATIM to the chain's EXISTING --trial_vram_budget_gb /
#   --formal_vram_budget_gb on every stage-1 band and stage-2 unit. This is a
#   TRANSPORT SEAM CARRYING NO VALUE: the campaign's ceiling is
#   HARDWARE_DERIVED / PENDING_H100_QUALIFICATION, so no number is frozen,
#   defaulted or embedded anywhere on this path. Before this seam existed the
#   Gold layer had no VRAM surface at all, so a qualified number had nothing
#   to travel through — the pin would have been real and unconsumed, the
#   F-LLM-WIRE-1 class again.
#
#   SUPPLY BOTH OR NEITHER. They are two independent per-mode ceilings (M4
#   may measure trial and formal differently, and formal rounds are the
#   larger), so they are NOT collapsed into one operator value — that would
#   assert trial == formal, an interpretation nobody granted. But a HALF
#   supply is refused at this boundary: a capped trial beside an uncapped
#   formal on four co-resident bands is precisely the exhaustion the ceiling
#   exists to prevent, and the stage scripts fork one background chain per
#   band, so a half-cap noticed downstream has already launched the fleet.
#
#   UNSUPPLIED IS LEGAL AND INERT — no token reaches the child argv and the
#   launch is byte-identical to a pre-seam one. It does NOT refuse, unlike
#   the generated-library root: omitting a ceiling diverges from no pinned
#   authority (_chain_common.sh defaults both to empty == omit, which is the
#   state every campaign launch has run in), and making the seam a launch
#   blocker for a value the campaign deliberately has not frozen would block
#   pre-M4 rehearsals to protect nothing. Absence is instead PRINTED in the
#   dry-run table and RECORDED as null in the launch manifest, so "no ceiling
#   was supplied" is an observed fact rather than a silence.
#
#   UNITS ARE NOT SETTLED HERE, DELIBERATELY. D-HW-6 flags a live GB/GiB gap
#   (the flags spell '_gb' but agent/skills/evaluate_vram_skill/wrapper.py
#   multiplies by _GB = 1024**3, i.e. GiB). This seam carries the operator's
#   value UNCHANGED and adds no conversion, no normalisation and no
#   unit-assuming validator: a transport that silently interprets units
#   acquires an authority nobody granted, and would close D-HW-6's question
#   by accident. The only check is a unit-NEUTRAL shape check (a strictly
#   positive decimal). The chain-level spellings are RESERVED passthrough.
#
# --dry-run prints the frozen table and every fully-resolved per-band (or
# per-unit) run_chain argv without launching anything or writing any file.
