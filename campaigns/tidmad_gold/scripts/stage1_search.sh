# SIDERIUS Gold campaign — STAGE 1 fan-out (exec, do not source)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Role   : launch the per-band search for the selected bands, ONE BAND PER
#          GPU per the frozen single-resident map (0-3->0, 4-9->1,
#          10-14->2, 15-19->3). Each band is one stage1_run_band.sh
#          process, nohup'd with a stagger between starts (so four
#          cold-start VRAM probes and LLM bursts never land in the same
#          second — the fleet-launcher pattern, reused).
#
# Called by run_gold_campaign.sh; may also be invoked directly with the
# same argument vocabulary (the frozen boundary is the sourced lib either
# way, so no value can fork between the two paths). That claim is only
# true because this script calls the lib's group builders ITSELF: the
# entrypoint's both-or-neither refusals ran one layer above the fan-out,
# and until N-1..N-7 remediation a direct invocation reached the fan-out
# without them.
#
# Logs   : ${WORKSPACE_ROOT}/gold_stage1_logs/${ARM}_band${BAND}.launch.log
#          per band, plus a PID manifest gold_stage1_${ARM}_<epoch>.pids
#          ("band pid logfile" rows) for monitoring and shutdown.
#
# --dry-run runs each selected band's stage1_run_band.sh --dry-run in the
# FOREGROUND (fully-resolved argv per band, nothing launched, no writes).
