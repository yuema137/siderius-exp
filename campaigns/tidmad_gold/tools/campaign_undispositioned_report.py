"""REPORT ONLY — rows a disposition-scoped census structurally cannot see.

NOT A GUARD. This module asserts nothing, is not a test, and is not wired into
CI. Running it prints a report; nothing fails. That is deliberate and dated —
see ENFORCEMENT_IS_OWED below.

THE DEFECT IT MEASURES
----------------------
The tag-time release-blocker census, and the executable guard at
``tests/campaigns/test_tidmad_gold_decision_census.py``, range over rows where
``disposition == "RELEASE_BLOCKER"``. A row carrying **no disposition field at
all** is not evaluated in either direction: it cannot be reported open and it
cannot be reported closed. It is not in the domain.

This is the shape *"the set a check ranges over was chosen by what was
convenient to enumerate."* It has already bitten once: ``R-OBS-1`` and
``D-BUD-16`` were repaired row-by-row on 2026-08-27 (master's own `reconciled`
prose on ``R-OBS-1`` names the mechanism verbatim — *"a disposition-scoped
census could not see it in EITHER direction"*), and ``D-BUD-17`` was then
missed, because that repair enumerated the rows someone noticed instead of
deriving the set.

So this module derives the domain from what a row IS:

    a row COULD be a blocker if it declares `blocking_v0_1_0: true`,
    or carries `blocked_on:`, or has an F- / R- / Q- prefixed id

...and reports every such row that carries no ``disposition``.

WHY IT DOES NOT ENFORCE
-----------------------
Measured 2026-08-27 against the ledger at that date: the predicate surfaces 23
rows, of which 7 are already CLOSED under the ruled closure predicate (adding a
disposition to those is pure label churn) and 16 are not. Of the 16, the large
majority need a genuine routing decision that belongs to the operator or the
Supervisor — not to whoever is running the census. Enforcing before the tag
would convert a documentation debt into a release blocker.

A disposition-scoped census that silently cannot see these rows is dishonest.
A non-enforcing report that says so, with its enforcement recorded as owed, is
not. That is the trade this file makes explicit rather than leaving implied.

ENFORCEMENT_IS_OWED
-------------------
Recorded 2026-08-27, awaiting Supervisor routing of the open rows. When they
carry dispositions, this predicate should become an assertion in
``tests/campaigns/test_tidmad_gold_decision_census.py`` and this module should be
deleted rather than left as a report nobody runs. Until then the debt is
visible here instead of invisible in the census's domain.

**Tracked as issue #371** ("census domains chosen by convenience"), which
carries this finding alongside its siblings elsewhere in the repository. The
point #371 preserves, and the reason a row-by-row fix is the wrong repair: the
earlier pass that gave ``R-OBS-1`` and ``D-BUD-16`` dispositions **enumerated
the rows someone noticed rather than deriving the set**, which is why
``D-BUD-17`` was missed — and patching that one row would have looked like a
success while leaving the defect intact.

The same shape landed independently in ``F-N1`` on the same day: a fix whose
docstring claimed "every sibling authority already anchors this way" was false
about three constants, and its repair replaced the prose claim with a census
that AST-DISCOVERS ``LEGACY_DEFAULT_*`` instead of listing it. Two lanes, two
subsystems, one failure mode.
