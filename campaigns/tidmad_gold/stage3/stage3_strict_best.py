"""Stage-3 Strict Best finalization — post-search selection over Stage-2 retrains.

Contract
--------
``docs/campaign/stage_artifact_contract.md`` (landed via PR #329; FROZEN):

* §2 — Stage-2 layout: one retrain unit per ``{workspace_root}/stage2/
  {design}_{target_band}/`` holding ``deliverables/`` (the unit's
  TARGET-BAND ABRA-format HDF5 files — Q-S3-2 ruling A, 2026-08-26; a
  design's four band dirs partition 0..19) and ``COMPLETE.json``, written
  LAST by atomic rename. The marker is
  the ONLY completion signal: absence == not done, partial dirs without it
  are never evidence of anything.
* §3 — consumption rule: ``strict_best`` reads Stage-2 ``deliverables/``
  dirs, only from units whose ``COMPLETE.json`` exists and has
  ``healthgate_valid: true``.
* §4 — the shared composer boundary ``compose_and_score(deliverable_dirs, *,
  files=range(20), sample_set=None) -> (file_vector, scalar)``, owned by the
  sibling lane's ``scripts/stage3/stage3_common.py``. It wraps the frozen
  ``score_vector`` arithmetic EXACTLY ONCE over all 20 files; missing or
  duplicated deliverables are its refusal, not ours — this module never
  re-checks file-level coverage and never re-inlines ``score_vector``.

Operator-frozen semantics (Strict Best lane)
--------------------------------------------
Stage-2 retrained each of the campaign's 4 frozen winner DESIGNS (complete
candidate identity — never Stage-1 weights) from scratch on each of the 4
bands = 16 units. Per design this module verifies its 4 units, pools the 4
band ``deliverables/`` dirs, and obtains StrictScore(design) from ONE
``compose_and_score`` call at full 0..19 scope. Across designs it selects
the best StrictScore under :class:`~execute_tools.metric_order.MetricOrder`
— direction always read from the metric declaration, never assumed from a
literal (this file contains no ``max``/``min``/``sorted`` and no comparison
against a direction string; an AST census in the tests pins that).

Per-band scalars are deliberately INEXPRESSIBLE here (campaign rule SRI-11,
the F-SCAND-1 lesson one stage up): there is exactly one composer call site,
no division, no ``sum``/``mean``-family arithmetic, and no numeric value in
any band-scoped output node. ``COMPLETE.json.denoising_score`` (a Stage-2
unit's own band-scoped score) is validated for marker well-formedness and
then never read again — it must not appear in any output, log line, refusal
message, or provenance field of this module (coordinator hazard flag,
2026-08-26). Per-band information leaves this module ONLY as per-FILE
entries of the full-scope ``file_vector``.

Fail-closed decision (flagged for the operator)
-----------------------------------------------
"A unit without the marker or without validity is a NAMED refusal, never a
skip." This module implements the STRICT reading: any refused unit among the
required 4 designs x 4 bands fails the WHOLE finalization closed — every
failing unit is named, the composer is never invoked, no selection artifact
is written, and the CLI exits 2. No degraded best-of-N selection is ever
emitted, mirroring the §4 composer precedent (a missing file refuses the
whole call). The alternative reading — select among the surviving designs
and name the refusals alongside — was deliberately NOT implemented; if the
operator wants it, it is a semantic change to this module, not a default.

Band vocabulary
---------------
The contract's Conventions line fixes ``{BAND}`` ∈ ``0-3 | 4-9 | 10-14 |
15-19`` and names the (not yet landed) F-LAUNCH-1 band launcher's map as the
authority, cross-checked by ``campaign_preflight.sh`` R6. Until that map is
importable, :data:`BAND_VOCABULARY` restates the contract vocabulary here,
verbatim and cited; converging on the launcher's map is a follow-up for the
launcher lane.

Sibling dependency
------------------
``scripts/stage3/stage3_common.py`` is owned by a parallel writer lane and
is bound lazily by module path (see :func:`_resolve_compose_and_score`), so
this module imports, type-checks, and unit-tests cleanly before the sibling
lands; tests stub the boundary with the frozen §4 signature.
