"""Stage-3 terminal 100% champion re-evaluation (stage artifact contract, PR #329 §3).

Semantics (operator-frozen): after search freezes and the champion is
selected, ONE terminal full-scope (100% eval scope) measurement is taken.
Selection happens FIRST; the terminal number NEVER feeds back into search.

Everything this module writes lives under the contract's terminal
namespace, ``{workspace_root}/stage3/terminal_eval/`` — the ISOLATION
namespace. The contract's frozen isolation rule (§3): nothing under that
directory is ever read by any search, selection, tuning, or
scoring-for-selection code path. This module is the namespace's ONE
producer, and it enforces its side of the rule structurally:

- every output path is validated against the terminal namespace **at
  construction** (:class:`TerminalOutputLayout`); an outside path is a
  named :class:`TerminalNamespaceViolationError` before any side effect;
- a champion without HealthGate-valid provenance is refused by name
  (:class:`InvalidChampionError`) through the ONE eligibility authority,
  ``classify_under_pinned_policy`` (``execute_tools/health_checks/
  candidate_eligibility.py``), against the gate set the champion's OWN
  workspace pinned — a numerically excellent invalid champion must NOT be
  terminal-evaluated as a success, and neither must an UNKNOWN one;
- the read-closure guard (:func:`audit_terminal_read_closure` /
  :func:`assert_terminal_read_closure`) enumerates the input roots of
  every search-side consumer per the contract's enumerated-roots clause
  and proves the terminal namespace is in none of them — including
  detecting a terminal artifact *planted* inside a search-consumable
  root (every artifact emitted here self-declares its namespace, so a
  copied plant is recognizable);
- no band-level scalar is ever emitted (campaign-lane hazard flag,
  2026-08-26): the terminal score exists only at full 0..19 scope, and
  per-band information may appear only as per-FILE vector entries. The
  write path refuses band-shaped scalar fields
  (:class:`BandScalarEmissionError`).

Scoring goes through the shared ``compose_and_score`` wrapper (contract
§4, frozen signature) owned by ``scripts/stage3/stage3_common.py``. That
module lands in a parallel writer's PR, so it is resolved dynamically at
call time; :class:`ComposeAndScoreFn` pins the frozen signature at this
seam. This module never re-inlines ``score_vector``.

Contract change control: the search-side consumer enumeration
(:data:`SEARCH_SIDE_CONSUMERS`) and the namespace segments
(:data:`TERMINAL_NAMESPACE_SEGMENTS`) are executable images of the
contract's frozen clauses. Any edit here is a CONTRACT change and must be
made in ``docs/campaign/stage_artifact_contract.md`` first; the pinned
tests in ``tests/unit/scripts/stage3/test_terminal_eval.py`` fail loudly
otherwise.

            best-effort (recorded as null when unresolvable).
