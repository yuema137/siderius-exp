"""Stage-3 writer: Composed Best (stage_artifact_contract.md §1, §3, §4).

Selects four Stage-1 band winners, replays their exact checkpoints through the
task-owned full-scope inference path, and emits one authoritative Composed Best
Golden score plus provenance under ``{workspace_root}/stage3/composed_best/``.

Winner identification implements the contract's §1 table literally, through
the cited authorities and nothing else:

* completed scoring — ``record["status"] == "success"``;
* FORMAL round — ABSENCE of the ``is_trial`` key (the ``BestTracks``
  authority, ``nodes/ml_hyperparameter_tune_agent/policy.py``: "Formal
  records have no ``is_trial`` key"; the top-level ``trial_portion`` key is
  likewise trial-only, #316 B2). A record carrying ``is_trial`` with any
  value other than ``True``, or carrying ``trial_portion`` without
  ``is_trial``, is a shape production never writes — REFUSED loudly, never
  silently included or excluded;
* HealthGate-valid — ``is_valid_candidate`` (the ONE eligibility authority,
  ``execute_tools/health_checks/candidate_eligibility.py``), resolved
  against the workspace's own pinned ``health_checks_effective.yaml``
  through ``resolve_scientific_gate_ids`` — the resolver's documented
  resume-time pattern, so this consumer cannot disagree with in-run
  selection. A ``None`` resolution (roles unknown) is a refusal, never a
  fallback to the repo-current default;
* direction — ``MetricOrder`` over the run outputs' stamped
  ``metric_spec`` identity. Never assumed higher-is-better; a missing or
  divergent stamp is a refusal.

The winner identity includes the exact checkpoint digest. Stage 3 copies that
checkpoint and the winner's run-scoped plugins into an isolated workspace,
uses the existing inference executor over all 200 segments of each source-band
file, and validates each complete HDF5 deliverable before scoring. Stage-1's
bounded 10% deliverables are search evidence only and are never final inputs.

No per-band scalar exists anywhere in this writer's outputs, logs, or
provenance (F-SCAND-1). Winner provenance entries carry IDENTITY ONLY —
never the winning record's own band-scoped ``denoising_score``, because a
band-scoped aggregate is exactly the scalar this stage must not put next to
three others. Per-band information appears only as per-FILE vector entries.

Reads are strictly read-only against Stage-1 workspaces. The pooled input is a
symlink farm inside the Stage-3 namespace pointing at newly replayed full-scope
deliverables, never at Stage-1's partial outputs.
