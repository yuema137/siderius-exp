"""Stage-3 shared compose-and-score module (stage_artifact_contract.md §4).

The ONE wrapper every Stage-3 writer calls (composed_best / strict_best /
the terminal-evaluation writer — contract §4: "All three writers ... call
THIS function; none re-inlines ``score_vector``").

Frozen semantics implemented here, quoted from the contract:

* Wraps the existing ``score_vector`` authority **EXACTLY ONCE** — one call
  over all 20 files with the canonical committed anchor map (global
  ``s_max`` ruler).
* For each file 0-19, exactly ONE deliverable must resolve across
  ``deliverable_dirs`` — a missing index is a ``NotScoreableError``-class
  refusal (never a silent skip); a duplicate index is a refusal naming both
  paths.
* The frozen TIDMAD score formula is byte-untouched; this module composes
  INPUTS, never arithmetic.

**No per-band scalar exists anywhere in this module** (F-SCAND-1: the
slice-mean aggregation is refused; F-SCAND-4 verified the valid
construction). The reuse anchor is ``scripts/score_tidmad_official_banded.py``
(one pooled deliverable set, one ``score_vector`` call, anchor ``s_max``
ruler) — that script's safety is STRUCTURAL: it computes zero band scalars,
so none can be averaged. This module preserves the property structurally:
per-band information is expressible only as per-FILE vector entries, there is
no aggregation of any kind here (a repo test pins the deliberate omission —
SRI-11), and a partial ``files`` range is refused at the boundary so a band
scalar cannot even be requested.

Deliverable resolution and filename semantics both come from the
``DeliverableNaming`` authority (``execute_tools/deliverable_spec.py``) —
``input_identity_of`` is the contract's own inverse parser, so this module
never restates the filename template with a regex of its own.

``score_vector`` receives ABSOLUTE deliverable paths through
``denoised_filename_fn`` with an inert ``data_dir=""`` — the production-
blessed pass-through: ``os.path.join`` discards the base when the right-hand
side is absolute (``nodes/ml_hyperparameter_tune_agent/records.py``
``_build_denoised_filename`` documents exactly this, and production scoring
already calls ``score_vector`` this way at ``core/sandbox_executor.py:2061``).
