# Stage Artifact & Layout Contract (Gold campaign) — FROZEN-BY-CONTRACT

**Status**: the minimum stable contract the three Stage-3 writers and the
Stage-1/2 launcher build against (operator scheduling ruling, 2026-08-26:
this contract lands BEFORE the launcher; any later launcher change that
moves a path is a CONTRACT change to this file, never a surprise).
Owner: Lane F. Everything marked **FROZEN** below is load-bearing for at
least two lanes. Where a layout already exists in production, this file
DOCUMENTS it (with the source of truth cited); where it does not
(Stage-2/3), it fixes the simplest shape consistent with the frozen
architecture.

Conventions: `{workspace_root}` = the campaign's persistent root (R1-checked
mount). `{arm}` ∈ the campaign's two arm labels (opaque strings; stamped as
`experiment_arm`, which is in `RunInvariants._CANONICAL` — a wrong label is
pinned and compared, so the launcher stamps it once, correctly). `{BAND}` ∈
`0-3 | 4-9 | 10-14 | 15-19` (the DS8 band vocabulary; the band launcher's
own map is the authority, `campaign_preflight.sh` R6 cross-checks it).

## 1. Stage-1 — per-band chain workspaces (EXISTING layout, documented)

**FROZEN paths** (source of truth: `run_chain.sh` + `run_one_iteration.py
prepare_iteration_dir`, `:805` — "Create `{workspace}/iter_{N:03d}`"):

```
{workspace_root}/{arm}_band{BAND}/                  # one chain workspace per band per arm
  run_invariants_lock.json                          # core/run_invariants.py — pins scope, arm, health sha
  health_checks_effective.yaml                      # the run's pinned effective Health config
  iter_{N:03d}/                                     # N from 1, zero-padded width 3
    manifest.json                                   # write-once, self-digested (#258); status ∈ completed|failed|no_records
    <node output records>                           # {node}_{run_name}.json per the storage contract
    <tuner sub-workspace>/                          # the tuner sandbox base_dir for this iteration
      configs/ data/ ...                            # TidmadSandbox.dirs
```

**Manifest scientific posture** (F-SCANB-3, additive; the three-value
`status` vocabulary above is UNCHANGED). `status` is the CHAIN-CONTROL token
— it answers "may the next iteration chain off this artifact?", which
`core/resume.py`, Stage 3 and `scripts/inspect_run_state.py` all branch on,
and a trial-only iteration still produces a consumable `run_output` and a
restorable plugin. It never answered "did a formal round run?", and until
this fix nothing did: `best_score` was `best_denoising_score`, the top
record over ALL records with trial and formal mixed, so every v20 attempt-3
manifest read `status: "completed"` with a TRIAL score as the headline. The
manifest now carries, on EVERY branch:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `best_score` | the FORMAL best (`best_formal_denoising_score`); `null` when no formal round produced one |
| `raw_best_score` | the mixed top score, unchanged, under the name that says what it is |
| `formal_evidence` | `{record_count, formal_record_count, formal_success_count, has_formal_evidence}`, counted by the ONE role authority `core/record_role.is_formal_role` — the same rule this section's winner table states |

`scripts/inspect_run_state.py` renders the two scores as separate columns
("Mixed Best" / "Formal Best") and states `formal_success=K/N` per row.

**FROZEN deliverable naming**: filenames resolve EXCLUSIVELY through the
run's `DeliverableNaming` authority (`execute_tools/deliverable_spec.py`;
construction helper `records._build_denoised_filename`). The shipped TIDMAD
template renders `abra_validation_denoised_{model_type}_{run_name}_{exp_id}_{NNNN}.h5`
with `NNNN` = the input identity 0–19 zero-padded width 4 (prose corrected
to match the authority's live rendering — the earlier `_file{NNNN}` example
contradicted the resolve-exclusively sentence above, which governs; found by
writer C; Lane F owns the contract — flagged for its ack). Deliverables are
ABRA-format HDF5, written into the iteration's tuner sandbox data dir
(`base_dir`); every path a consumer receives from a record is ABSOLUTE
(Bug-A contract, `records.py:573`).

**FROZEN retention clause**: Stage-1 campaign chains run with formal-round
deliverable RETENTION — the launcher must NOT pass `--cleanup_denoised`
for campaign runs (the historical standard command did; a cleaned formal
winner leaves Stage-3 nothing to pool). The F-LAUNCH-1 entrypoint binds
this; until it exists, any hand launch of a campaign chain must omit the
flag.

**FROZEN winner identification** (field names, from the persisted
`ExperimentRecord` dicts in the iteration records; authorities cited):

A record is the band's *cumulative best HealthGate-valid FORMAL winner* iff
it maximizes `denoising_score` under `MetricOrder` (direction from the
run's `MetricSpec`; do NOT assume higher-is-better in code) over all
records in the band workspace satisfying ALL of:

| condition | field / authority |
|---|---|
| completed scoring | `status == "success"` |
| FORMAL round | **`is_trial` absent or `False`** (Q-S3-3 correction, 2026-08-26: the BUILDER sets the key only on trial records, but `HyperparamTuningOutput.all_records: list[ExperimentRecord]` re-validates and `model_dump()` MATERIALIZES the defaults `is_trial: False` + `trial_portion: None` onto every PERSISTED formal record — the shape Stage-3 reads; the `BestTracks` authority's own test is falsy-tolerant, `not r.get("is_trial", False)`, `policy.py:650`. The earlier "absence of the `is_trial` key" wording described only the in-memory dicts and made every real formal record refuse. A non-bool `is_trial`, or a non-`None` `trial_portion` on a formal-shaped record, remains a shape production never writes — #316 B2) |
| HealthGate-valid | `classify_under_pinned_policy(record, pinned_workspace_gate_ids(workspace))` == `VALID` (`execute_tools/health_checks/candidate_eligibility.py` — the ONE eligibility authority; never re-implement from gate fields). **F-4 correction, 2026-08-27**: the gate set is the one the RUN'S OWN workspace pinned in `health_checks_effective.yaml`, never the repo-current shipped `configs/health_checks.yaml`. The previous wording named `is_valid_candidate(record)`, whose zero-argument default resolves the repo-current config and collapses UNKNOWN to the empty set — so a record whose run-declared blocking gate FAILED was reported valid on the strength of a roster it never ran. A workspace that pinned no roster is UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN is a refusal, not a pass. `stage3_composed_best.select_band_winner` already resolved it this way; this is the other two consumers matching it. |
| identity | `exp_id`, `model_type`, `iteration` (dir), `experiment_arm` (lock + manifest) |

Its Stage-1 deliverables cover the bounded Stage-1 Formal evaluation scope and
remain search evidence. They are not Stage-3 final-score inputs. The winner's
exact checkpoint, completion sentinel, model/loss configuration, inference
batch, run-scoped plugins, and checkpoint SHA-256 form the replay identity.

## 2. Stage-2 — frozen-design retrain units (NEW layout, fixed here)

**FROZEN**: one directory per retrain unit, 16 units, launched as 4 GPU
waves (wave membership is launcher policy, not layout):

```
{workspace_root}/stage2/{design}_{target_band}/     # e.g. wavenetA_0-3
  workspace/                                        # a normal single-iteration chain/tuner workspace (Stage-1 rules apply inside, incl. iter_001/)
  deliverables/                                     # the unit's TARGET-BAND ABRA-format HDF5 files (that band's files ONLY), COPIED (not symlinked) from the workspace after completion, named by the SAME DeliverableNaming authority
  COMPLETE.json                                     # completion marker, written LAST (atomic rename), schema below
```

Q-S3-2 ruling A (supervisor, 2026-08-26): a unit's `deliverables/` carries
its TARGET-BAND files only — a band-scoped run under `--data_scope <band>`
produces the scope's files ONLY (DS8's enforced behaviour), the paper's own
band-split construction infers per band, and a design's four band dirs then
partition 0..19 so strict_best's whole-dir pooling composes with zero
duplicates. The earlier "20 files per unit" wording could never compose
(the §4 composer refuses duplicate indices by frozen rule).

`{design}` = the frozen-design identifier (16 total; the design registry is
the campaign plan's, not this contract's). `{target_band}` uses the same
band vocabulary as Stage-1.

**FROZEN `COMPLETE.json` schema** (the marker is the ONLY thing Stage-3
polls; absence == unit not done; partial dirs without it are ignored):

```json
{
  "design": "<design id>",
  "target_band": "<band>",
  "exp_id": "<the retrain's exp_id>",
  "model_type": "<plugin model_type>",
  "repo_sha": "<git sha the unit ran at>",
  "denoising_score": <float, the unit's own formal score>,
  "healthgate_valid": <bool, its record's validity under the UNIT WORKSPACE'S OWN pinned effective config — see section 1 (F-4)>,
  "deliverable_count": <int, the TARGET band's file count under the DS8 band vocabulary — Q-S3-2 ruling A>,
  "completed_utc": "<ISO8601>"
}
```

---

## 3. Stage-3 — consumption points (NEW, fixed here)

```
{workspace_root}/stage3/
  composed_best/        # writer A: full-scope checkpoint replay, then one pooled score
  strict_best/          # writer B: pools Stage-2's 4×4 (per design-quad selection rule, writer-owned)
  terminal_eval/        # writer C: the ISOLATION namespace — see the rule below
    <input>/            # whatever terminal evaluation consumes
    <results>/
```

**FROZEN consumption rules**:
- `composed_best` selects one Stage-1 winner per band using §1, verifies and
  stages its exact checkpoint and run-scoped plugins, and invokes the existing
  task-owned inference executor over all 200 segments of each file in that
  source band. It does not retrain. Every replayed HDF5 deliverable must pass
  the declared naming, storage, file identity, and complete-sample-count check
  before it may enter the pooled set. A Stage-1 20-segment deliverable is
  insufficient by construction and is never consumed as a final result.
- `strict_best` reads Stage-2 `deliverables/` dirs, only from units whose
  `COMPLETE.json` exists and has `healthgate_valid: true`. §2's "ignored"
  governs the POLLER while it waits; the strict_best FINALIZER fails
  closed — any unit missing its marker, malformed, or
  `healthgate_valid: false` at finalization time is one aggregated named
  refusal (zero composer calls, no selection emitted) — Q-S3-1 ruling A
  (supervisor, 2026-08-26; operator-overridable).
- **Isolation rule for `terminal_eval` (FROZEN)**: nothing under
  `{workspace_root}/stage3/terminal_eval/` is ever read by any search,
  selection, tuning, or scoring-for-selection code path — structurally
  guaranteed because (a) no Stage-1/2 workspace and no Stage-3 writer A/B
  takes a path under `terminal_eval/` as input (their input roots are
  enumerated above and are disjoint from it), and (b) the directory name
  is reserved by this contract: any future consumer adding a read from it
  is making a CONTRACT change here first.

---

## 4. The shared compose-and-score interface (ONE wrapper, reused 3×)

**FROZEN signature** (module suggested: `scripts/stage3/compose_and_score.py`;
the implementer may relocate the module — the SIGNATURE and semantics are
the frozen part):

```python
def compose_and_score(
    deliverable_dirs: list[str],      # pooled dirs; each holds ABRA-format .h5 deliverables
    *,
    files: range = range(20),         # the full 0..19 file set — full-scope by contract
    sample_set: None = None,          # None == the FULL sample set; partial scopes are not legal here
    reconciled_spec: MetricSpec,      # §4 amendment (supervisor gate ruling, 2026-08-26): the caller's RECONCILED 09a stamp — identity transport for refusal envelopes, never derived
    raw_data_dir: str | None = None,  # Composed Best passes its required explicit data root; legacy writers may use TIDMAD_DATA_DIR
) -> tuple[list[float], float]:       # (file_vector, scalar) — score_vector's own 2-tuple
```

§4 amendment (supervisor local-gate Step-09a ruling, 2026-08-26): the
MetricSpec has ONE stamping authority — the tuner's derivation, persisted
as `HyperparamTuningOutput.metric_spec`. Stage-3 consumers RECONCILE
stamped specs through `execute_tools.evaluation_metric.reconcile_metric_specs`
and never derive: composed_best across its four band winners' outputs,
strict_best across its 16 units' chain-workspace outputs (read through the
same manifest-verified loader), terminal_eval from the champion's stamped
`metric_spec` field. An absent or divergent stamp is a NAMED fail-closed
refusal — a pre-09a-shaped input refuses, never defaults. The reconciled
spec is passed to `compose_and_score`, which uses it ONLY to name the
metric in its refusal envelopes.

Semantics, all FROZEN:
- Wraps the existing `score_vector` authority (`execute_tools`/scoring)
  EXACTLY ONCE — one call over all 20 files with the canonical committed
  anchor map (global `s_max` ruler). **No per-band scalars exist anywhere**
  (F-SCAND-1: the slice-mean aggregation is refused; F-SCAND-4 verified
  the valid construction). Reuse anchor:
  `scripts/score_tidmad_official_banded.py` — writes per-band outputs into
  one pooled temp dir, then "scores all 20 files in one `score_vector`
  call".
- For each file 0–19, exactly ONE deliverable must resolve across
  `deliverable_dirs` (missing → `NotScoreableError`-class refusal, never a
  silent skip; duplicates → refusal naming both paths).
- The frozen TIDMAD score formula is byte-untouched; this wrapper composes
  INPUTS, never arithmetic.
- All three writers (composed_best / strict_best / terminal_eval) call THIS
  function; none re-inlines `score_vector`.

## Change control

Every field above marked FROZEN is release-contract material: a change is a
PR to THIS file with the supervisor's review, announced to lanes B/C/D —
never an incidental edit riding a launcher or writer PR.
