"""The wave summary: one canonical fact, one derived view.

V20 PR E, D-E-3 and D-E-3a.

The wave record used to be an eleven-positional shell ``printf`` that
could express exactly two chains named ``arch`` and ``loss``. §20.7 asks
that a campaign with one chain, or five, or chains named for something
else, not require a schema change — and a positional formatter cannot
emit a variable-length array. It moves here, for the same reason
``campaign_spend`` moved: a shell scan of nested JSON silently inflated
the number a cost cap depended on, and a shell ``printf`` emitting a
nested array is that hazard one step further along.

**Which copy is true is stated before it is written, not discovered when
the two disagree.**

    canonical : <home>/queue_state/wave_state.jsonl   append-only history
    derived   : <home>/pair_summaries/wave_<n>_<tag>.json   mutable snapshot

    1. append to the canonical JSONL, flush, fsync
    2. only then, atomically replace the derived file

A failure between the steps loses the *convenience*, never the
*evidence*, and a derived file that exists without a canonical line is
therefore a detectable inconsistency rather than a normal state. The two
failures are reported distinctly (`CanonicalWriteError` vs
`DerivedWriteError`) because "the summary is missing" and "the evidence
is missing" call for different operator responses.

**``record_id`` exists because the two views age differently.** The JSONL
appends and the per-wave file overwrites, so a retried wave leaves two
records and one file. Every record carries

    <campaign_id>:<wave>:<band_tag>:<attempt>

with ``attempt`` resolved by counting the canonical records that already
match the first three fields — derived from persisted evidence, not from
launcher state a restart would lose. "Which attempt is this file?" is
answered by reading the file; "how many were there?" by the JSONL.

**A note on the field name inside ``chains``.** It is ``run_name``, not
``run``, and that is load-bearing rather than stylistic. The launcher
decides completion with

    grep '"run": "<X>"' wave_state.jsonl | grep -q '"exit": 0'

over the whole line. A ``chains`` array spelled ``{"run": …, "exit": 0}``
would let a wave summary in which one chain succeeded satisfy that
predicate for *every* chain it names — so a chain that exited 137 would
be skipped as complete on the next resume. Measured, not theorised, and
guarded by a regression test.
