"""Documented commands must parse against the code that actually runs.

V20 PR C2.

Two failures this catches, both of which already happened in this PR:

* the Gate packet named `--formal_eval_portion`, which the harness did not
  implement — the approved command could not have run;
* the harness's formal arm ran only `execute_training` while the packet
  described a training **and** inference comparison.

A prose review missed both. These check the documents against `argparse`
and against the source, so a rename or a dropped flag fails here rather
than at the start of a gate.
