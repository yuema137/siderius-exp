"""The gate harness delegates; it does not become a second implementation.

V20 PR C2.

`bg_admission_validation.py` states the risk in its own words: *"a
validation that replaces the thing it is validating proves only that the
replacement works."* A harness that grew its own sampler, its own
classifier, or a hand-built requirement would produce green gate artifacts
about code nobody runs.

So these tests are structural as well as behavioural: they assert that the
harness calls the SAME production functions the tuner calls, and that it
defines none of their logic itself.
