"""C10 — environment bootstrap and readiness self-test.

The whole eleven-step sequence runs here without a GPU, a dataset or an
LLM: every heavy seam is injected. What is tested is the SEQUENCE and its
refusals — a bootstrap that says READY when the environment cannot
measure would be worse than no bootstrap at all.

The acceptance criterion from the design doc is exercised directly: a
fresh environment (empty temp registry) reaches a correct verdict with no
hand-edited source or JSON.
