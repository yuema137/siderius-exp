formats, information classes, metadata fields, parameters, cost hints, and question IDs from the
supplied contracts. Metadata parameters grant no access: the binding must request the exact field.
For each binding, requested_information must include the selected slot's required_information
and may add only information declared by that same slot's optional_information (plus exact
invocation-selected metadata when the slot declares it). The access policy may permit target on
a split, but that does not make target valid for a data-only slot. For a slot requiring only data
with no optional information, request only {"information_class":"data","fields":[]}; do not add
target to that binding. Use a declared target-capable slot if the question needs target evidence.
RequestedInformation.fields is conditional: use explicit names only when information_class is
"metadata". For "identity", "data", "target", "prediction", or "residual", fields must be empty.
Examples: {"information_class":"data","fields":[]} and
{"information_class":"prediction","fields":[]} are valid;
{"information_class":"metadata","fields":["snr"]} is valid; and
{"information_class":"prediction","fields":["prediction"]} is invalid.
For historical-model predictions, bind the trained-model asset with operation="infer"
only to a declared predictions slot. Its requested_information must be exactly
[{"information_class":"prediction","fields":[]}], with one explicit inference_inputs
binding for the authorized raw model input and the model's declared input format/information.
HistoricalInferenceConfiguration with determinism="deterministic" must omit seed or set it to
null; a numeric seed is valid only for determinism="stochastic_seeded". Do not add seed=0 to a
deterministic model just because other analysis actions use a sampling seed.
Generated programs and generated experiment skills accept only operation="materialize" for
ordinary input views or operation="infer" for trusted predictions; never operation="read".
A generated action consumes a certified view prepared by the framework, not a direct read.
This also applies to generated programs and generated experiment skills: trusted inference
produces a certified prediction view before untrusted analysis code runs. Generated code must
not load or execute the model itself. At most one inference binding is supported per generated
invocation. Never request metadata fields absent from the split access policy.
Use one invocation-level sampling plan for aligned bindings. Never materialize or infer hidden data.
An invocation's scope must be valid for EVERY bound asset, including the nested inference input.
For task-owned opaque scopes, do not copy a legacy file-partition scope from a different raw
asset. When all assets bound to an invocation share one exact certified scope, use
requested_scope={"kind":"certified_asset_scope","asset_id":"<one bound asset ID>"}.
The executor resolves this short reference from the certified asset descriptor; it grants no
new access. Never reference an unbound asset or use it to combine different certified scopes.
Choose explicit nperseg/frequency/lag/bin parameters when required. Invocation IDs must be safe
portable path components. Do not include commentary outside JSON."""

reference/configured toolbox was judged insufficient. Return strict JSON matching the authoritative
schema. Source must define exactly:

    def analyze(inputs, parameters, output_directory): ...

`source_code` is Python, not JSON. Inside source_code use Python literals `None`, `True`,
and `False`; never use JSON literals `null`, `true`, or `false`. JSON `null` remains valid in
the surrounding generated-program declaration where the declared schema permits it.

`inputs` maps final-plan binding IDs to read-only objects with `descriptor` and `arrays` mappings.
These mappings are read-only Mapping objects, not necessarily built-in dicts. Use mapping
operations (`obj["descriptor"]`, `descriptor["slot_id"]`, `arrays.get(...)`) or
`isinstance(value, collections.abc.Mapping)`; never use `isinstance(value, dict)` to decide
whether an authorized binding, descriptor, or array exists.
Binding IDs are chosen after source generation and need not equal declared slot IDs. Never
hard-code a binding ID or look up `inputs[slot_id]`; locate inputs by the certified
`descriptor["slot_id"]`, and support the declared slot cardinality. `arrays`
contains only the executor-authorized NPZ arrays: `example_ids`, `information__<class>`,
`metadata__<field>`, optional `valid_mask`, and for time-series views `channel_ids` plus exactly one
certified time-axis encoding (`time` or `time_start_seconds`/`time_step_seconds`). Never open task
paths yourself. `example_ids` are structural alignment values supplied with every authorized view;
do not declare `information_class="identity"` to obtain them. Identity information is available
only in safe discovery descriptors and cannot be requested for split materialization. `parameters`
contains validated scalar values. `output_directory` is the only
writable artifact directory. Return a plain JSON-serializable payload matching the SkillPayload
shape: summary, quantitative_results, produced_artifacts, analysis_usage, warnings. Write declared
artifacts below output_directory and declare paths relative to that same directory. For example,
writing `output_directory / "measurement.json"` requires `relative_path="measurement.json"`.
Do not prepend `artifacts/` unless you actually wrote into that subdirectory. Do not import SIDERIUS internals, inspect the workspace,
access credentials or network, install packages, alter data, or perform modeling/training. Declare
only concrete input information and view formats. A predictions input slot may consume certified
transient output from the trusted historical-inference capability; generated source never loads a
model or reads its raw inference inputs. Do not require metadata fields that the supplied access
policy does not authorize on the analysis split. Prefer a generic measurement based on certified
input properties and validated parameters when that keeps the operation clear. Do not embed a task
name, file number, fixed sample rate, or supposed signal answer where the same scientific question
can be expressed generically. A one-off program may remain task-local; only a genuinely reusable
operation should later be promoted. Generated parameter declarations obey this
conditional rule: `required=true` means the caller must supply the value and therefore `default`
must be null; a parameter with a usable default must set `required=false`. Do not redundantly mark
a parameter required while also assigning its value. The source and declaration will be persisted
and content-addressed before any executable plan exists. If `determinism` is `deterministic`,
declare an explicit non-negative `seed`; do not leave it null.

The raw runner ABI has these fixed shapes. Numeric views use `example_ids[N]`, information arrays
whose leading axis is N, optional scalar or `[N]` metadata, and optional per-example
`valid_mask[N]`. Time-series views use information arrays `[N,C,T]`, `channel_ids[C]`, and
per-observation `valid_mask[N,T]`; the mask is not an example-level boolean. A regular time axis is
`time_start_seconds[N]` plus `time_step_seconds[N]`; an explicit axis is `time[N,T]`. Do not guess
or transpose these certified axes.

SkillPayload also has validator-owned rules not fully expressed by JSON Schema: `analysis_usage`
counts the certified `descriptor["population_unit"]` (usually examples), not channel-series or
windows. `effective_count + dropped_count` must equal the certified selected/materialized count;
every dropped population unit has exactly one reason, drop reasons are unique, and their counts
must sum exactly to `dropped_count`. Every emitted quantitative result must copy its declared
`result_key`, `unit`, and `description` exactly, including description wording; only `value` is
computed at runtime. Artifact type and media type must likewise match their declarations exactly.
An absent required artifact, approximate field/description, or unbalanced usage count will be
rejected rather than normalized."""
