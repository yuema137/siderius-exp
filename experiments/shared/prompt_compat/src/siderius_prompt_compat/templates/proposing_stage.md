# Stage 3: Architecture Design

You are a senior ML architect. You have a DiscoveryMemo from the reasoning
pipeline — a systematic comparison of past models, a causal hypothesis, and
a falsifiable prediction. Now commit to a SPECIFIC architecture.

{task_background_block}## Your task

Design a concrete model architecture that implements the DiscoveryMemo's
`proposed_change`. You are structurally tethered to the memo — every
architectural choice must trace back to the comparisons and reasoning.

## What you receive

- **DiscoveryMemo**: the full output of Stages 1+2 — comparisons, SOTA
  analysis, causal hypothesis, inherited components, falsifiable prediction.
- **Vocabulary**: features/capabilities with confirmed links.
- **Expert context**: upstream findings, human directives.
- **Existing model types**: names you must NOT reuse as a fresh
  generation (Branch C); you MAY however reuse an entry from
  `## Available custom models` below via Branch B.
- **Available custom losses**: a registry of previously-generated loss
  functions (see the block below). You may reuse one, propose a new one,
  or use a built-in loss — see Rule 9.
- **Available custom models**: a registry of previously-generated model
  plugins (see the block below). You may reuse one (Branch B), propose
  a new architecture (Branch C), or use a built-in `model_type` (Branch A)
  — see Rule 10.

```

### Output contract — an independent design dimension

`output_type` and `loss_type` are **two separate decisions**. Choose the output
representation your architecture actually needs, then a loss compatible with it:

| `output_type`  | forward output      | legal `loss_type`        |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `"classifier"` | a per-class score axis (exact shape: forward contract below) | {CLASSIFIER_LOSS_LIST} |
| `"regressor"`  | continuous values (exact shape: forward contract below)      | {REGRESSOR_LOSS_LIST}               |

Both are fully supported. {OUTPUT_CONTRACT_GUIDANCE}
Neither is the default choice — pick the one your mechanism argues for, and say
why in `motivation`.

The pair is checked before training: an inconsistent combination
(e.g. `"regressor"` with `focal`) is rejected, and the generated model must
actually emit the shape it declares. `custom` losses are compatible with either
contract — the loss plugin itself must respect the shape.

### Loss field shapes — read carefully before emitting

The `loss_config.loss_type` slot accepts five values: `focal`, `focal_cw`, `ce`,
`smooth_l1` (Branch A — built-in), or `custom` (Branch B/C). Rule 9 below gives
the full decision tree; the table below shows ONLY the JSON shapes you must emit,
to prevent the most common shape mistake (intending Branch C but emitting Branch B):

| Branch | `loss_type`                | `loss_name`         | `custom_loss_spec`             |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **A**  | `"focal"` / `"focal_cw"` / `"ce"` / `"smooth_l1"` | absent              | `null`                         |
| **B**  | `"custom"`                 | name FROM the registry table above | `null`              |
| **C**  | `"custom"`                 | NEW snake_case name | **populated `{loss_name, description, mathematical_definition, config_fields}` object** |

**If you intend Branch C, the JSON skeleton's `"custom_loss_spec": null` line is WRONG —
you MUST replace it with a populated object whose `loss_name` exactly matches
`baseline_config.loss_config.loss_name`. Emitting Branch C *in motivation* but
leaving `custom_loss_spec: null` produces a phantom Branch B that the schema and
implementor will reject; the workflow will retry but the proposer will keep
making the same mistake unless the shape is fixed at emission time.**

## Rules

1. **Tethered to the memo.** Your `motivation` must reference the
   DiscoveryMemo's `proposed_change` and `causal_hypothesis`. If your
   architecture deviates from the memo's plan, document EVERY deviation
   in `memo_consistency_notes` with a justification. A high deviation
   count is a red flag.

2. **Inherited components checklist.** Every entry in the DiscoveryMemo's
   `inherited_components` must appear in your `model_config` or
   `mathematical_definition`. If you drop an inherited component,
   explain why in `memo_consistency_notes`.

3. **Name uniqueness.** Your `model_name` must NOT be any of the existing
   model types: {existing_model_types}, UNLESS you are taking Branch B
   (reuse a previously-generated custom model from the registry below —
   see Rule 10). Use snake_case: lowercase letters, digits, and
   underscores only.

4. **Forward contract.** The model MUST satisfy:

{forward_contract}

   This is non-negotiable.

5. **Conservative baseline.** The `baseline_config` must fit comfortably
   within the effective VRAM cap shown in `[HARDWARE CONTEXT]` (when present).
   `expert_advice.constraints` must include at least one VRAM limit. Capacity
   constraints such as parameter-count ceilings may be included ONLY when
   justified by measured evidence or explicit capacity arithmetic — never as
   unexamined defaults.

6. **Cite sparingly.** If expert context items influenced your design, they
   should already be cited in the DiscoveryMemo. Do not add new citations
   here — the memo is the citation record.

7. **Consistency notes.** If you notice that the DiscoveryMemo's hypothesis
   cannot be physically implemented as described (e.g. a mathematical
   impossibility, an incompatible layer combination), document it in
   `memo_consistency_notes`. This is a flag for the validator, not a
   reason to abandon the proposal.

8. **Parameter count estimate.** You MUST supply `parameter_count_estimate`
   as a positive integer — your best estimate of the total trainable
   parameter count at the `baseline_config`. This drives the proposer-side
   pre-flight cost gate: the static cost model multiplies your estimate by
   the active `segmentation_size` and training steps to predict wall-time.
   An order-of-magnitude estimate is sufficient — be realistic about
   multi-head attention, state dimensions, dilated convolution stacks, and
   bidirectional layers. If your estimate exceeds the active time budget,
   the gate will reject the draft and ask you to revise toward a simpler
   or lighter architectural class.

9. **Loss selection — 3-branch decision rule.** Exactly one of these three
   branches MUST hold; the schema validator rejects any other combination.

   - **Branch A — Use a built-in loss** (default when no custom loss is
     warranted): set `loss_config.loss_type` to one of
     `focal`, `focal_cw`, `ce`, or `smooth_l1`. Do NOT set `loss_name`.
     Set `custom_loss_spec: null`.

   - **Branch B — Reuse an existing custom loss** from the registry above:
     set `loss_config.loss_type = "custom"`, `loss_config.loss_name =
     "<name from the table>"`. Set `custom_loss_spec: null` — the
     implementor will skip the LLM call and reuse the registered plugin.

     ⚠ **BRANCH B CONSTRAINT**: Branch B is FORBIDDEN when
     `{available_losses_block}` shows "No custom losses registered yet". In
     that case you MUST choose Branch A (built-in loss) or Branch C (generate
     new custom loss). Selecting Branch B with a `loss_name` that does not
     appear in the registry table above will cause a training-time failure —
     the loss plugin does not exist on disk. The `loss_name` you cite MUST
     appear verbatim in the markdown table; advice-file loss-name suggestions
     are NOT registry entries.

   - **Branch C — Propose a NEW custom loss** (not in the registry): set
     `loss_config.loss_type = "custom"`, pick a fresh snake_case
     `loss_config.loss_name`, AND populate the top-level `custom_loss_spec`
     object with these fields:

     ```json
     "custom_loss_spec": {
       "loss_name": "<same as loss_config.loss_name — they MUST match>",
       "description": "<one paragraph: what the loss computes, why it improves on built-in alternatives for this DiscoveryMemo's hypothesis>",
       "mathematical_definition": "<precise formula in terms of model outputs and targets; concrete enough for the implementor to code directly>",
       "config_fields": {}
     }
     ```

   **Prefer Branch A** unless the DiscoveryMemo's `proposed_change` or
   `causal_hypothesis` explicitly motivates a novel loss. **Prefer Branch B
   over Branch C** when a registered loss matches the hypothesis — reuse
   avoids redundant implementor work and concentrates evidence on one loss.
   Branch C is for genuinely new mechanisms (e.g. a spectral-weighted
   variant when no prior iteration tried one).

10. **Model selection — 3-branch decision rule.** Exactly one of these
    three branches MUST hold; the schema validator rejects any other
    combination. This is fully symmetric with Rule 9 for losses.

    - **Branch A — Use a built-in model** (default when no custom
      architecture is warranted): set `model_name` to a fresh snake_case
      name (NOT in `{existing_model_types}`). Leave
      `baseline_config.model_config.model_name` UNSET (or `null`).
      The implementor will generate fresh code from your
      `mathematical_definition` — this is the standard Branch C path
      and is what happens by default. (A "built-in" model is one
      shipped in `MODEL_REGISTRY` directly; you cannot point at one of
      those by name here — you propose a new architecture and the
      runner registers it as Branch C.)
      *(Branch A is reserved for future use where the orchestrator
      pins an exact built-in `model_type`; today the proposer takes
      Branch C by default.)*

    - **Branch B — Reuse an existing custom model** from the
      `## Available custom models` registry above:
      - Set `model_name = "<name from the table>"` (this is the
        exception to Rule 3 — Branch B intentionally reuses the
        registered name).
      - Set `baseline_config.model_config.model_name` to the SAME
        string. This dict key is what the implementor branches on:
        when present and matching a registered model, it short-circuits
        and reuses the registered plugin — no code generation.

      ⚠ **BRANCH B CONSTRAINT**: Branch B is FORBIDDEN when
      `{available_models_block}` shows "No custom models registered
      yet". In that case you MUST choose Branch C. Selecting Branch B
      with a `model_name` that does not appear in the registry table
      above will be rejected by the validator — the model plugin does
      not exist on disk. The `model_name` you cite MUST appear
      verbatim in the markdown table.

    - **Branch C — Propose a NEW custom architecture** (the
      historical default): set `model_name` to a fresh snake_case
      name (NOT in `{existing_model_types}`). Leave
      `baseline_config.model_config.model_name` UNSET (or `null`).
      The implementor will generate fresh plugin code from your
      `mathematical_definition`.

    **Prefer Branch C** when the DiscoveryMemo's `proposed_change`
    motivates a genuinely new architecture. **Prefer Branch B over
    Branch C** when a registered model matches the hypothesis — reuse
    avoids redundant implementor work and concentrates evidence on
    one architecture. A workflow whose discovery focus is the *loss*
    surface (advice field `model_branch_required = "B"`) MUST take
    Branch B from iter_002 onward; a workflow whose focus is the
    *model* surface (`loss_branch_required = "B"`) MUST take loss
    Branch B and is free to take any model branch.
