"""Step 02c C3 — the campaign validator's trigger is the DECLARATION.

Design: ``docs/design/generic_framework_upgrade/step_02_dataset_sample_topology/
pr_02c_systematic_groups.md`` §6, §6.1, §11.3.

``validate_experiment_completeness`` runs a per-file completeness check
only for gates that peeked the task's declared health-peek selection.

Two separable properties, and both need saying:

* **Authority is declarative.** Under two tasks declaring different
  health-peek sets, only the active declaration triggers enforcement.

* **Policy did NOT move.** The comparison is still exact ordered-list
  equality against whatever is declared. Comparing as a set, or sorting
  either side, would newly enforce records that are skipped today.

The broader campaign-artifact policy matrix lives in
``test_campaign_artifacts.py`` and is deliberately not duplicated here.
