"""F-Q4-2 (v0.1.0, witnessed 2026-08-26) — the composed training child's
validation-declaration leg.

THE INCIDENT. Q4 v2 composed TIDMAD chain: 5/5 training attempts exited 1 on
``run_experiment_streaming``'s crosswise refusal ("refusing two"), zero
training, zero records. Mechanism: ``validation_rows_argv`` gated on scope
PRESENCE (``task_scopes.evaluation is not None``) — true on EVERY composed run
because every shipped implementation declares ``build_eval_scope`` — while a
composed run whose task declares physical geometry (composed TIDMAD) also
still supplies the legacy eval SampleSet (PR-12bc D-BC-13). So the training
child received BOTH declaration authorities, and D14-2 C5b's one-authority-
per-leg contract correctly refused.

THE DESIGN ANSWER (PR-12bc audit, frozen; now implemented by the emitter):
WHICH leg owns the validation-row declaration is the child's own dichotomy —
the PRESENCE of ``--eval_sample_set_json``. Under regime-A the child's
preflight is the ONLY declaration authority and ``--validation_requested_rows``
must stay off the wire; only the explicit leg (a transported eval scope
WITHOUT a regime-A eval SampleSet — every composed contrast run) consumes it.
The task-built evaluation scope still crosses on BOTH legs as scope IDENTITY.

HISTORY, and why the silence assertion below is mandatory: this defect has two
inversions. Pre-12d, rows were emitted by NOTHING and the explicit leg
(composed contrast) refused; 12d's fix emitted them on scope presence and the
regime-A leg (composed TIDMAD) refused. Each fix of one direction created the
other. The third inversion would start from the observation "the acquired eval
scope is not consumed for validation rows on the regime-A leg" being read as a
bug instead of the contract — so that consequence is asserted here BY NAME.

Un-composed byte-identity is NOT re-pinned here — it has standing owners:
``test_step12_pr12bc_b6_scope_transport.py::TestTheTrainingArgv::
test_an_un_composed_run_emits_no_scope_flag``,
``test_step12_pr12d_f12d27_training_scope_transport.py::
TestUncomposedArgvIsUnchanged`` and the D0 ``FORBIDDEN_ON_LEGACY`` guards.
The explicit-leg contrast witness (rows PRESENT when no SampleSet exists) is
likewise already owned by ``TestComposedScopeReachesTheTrainingChildWithout
ASampleSet`` and stays green — this module deliberately does not duplicate it.

Each test states the defect only it catches and how it fails when the
behaviour breaks.
