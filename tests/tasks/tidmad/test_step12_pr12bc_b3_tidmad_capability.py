"""Step 12 / PR-12bc — B3: TIDMAD's scope capability + the differential oracle.

Design:
``docs/design/generic_framework_upgrade/step_12_external_extensibility_graduation/
pr_12bc_generic_task_boundary_closure.md`` §M / B3; ledger §Q.B3.

TIDMAD implements the optional capability by **CALLING** ``build_sample_set``
— one authority, a relocated call, never a copy. The claim this module owns is
that the relocation changed nothing:

* **the differential oracle** — for every cell of
  ``(round_kind, strategy, portion, seed, subset)``, covering **trial AND
  formal**, the capability-built scope DEEP-EQUALS what the legacy path builds
  from the same inputs;
* **materialization parity** — a scope that has been serialized and read back
  produces the IDENTICAL visited sample sequence and step count as B0's
  recorded baseline, not merely the same config values;
* **canonical serialization** — asserted BYTE-wise, because the framework
  digests these bytes and two equal scopes that serialize differently would
  report a difference that does not exist;
* **fail-closed deserialization** — a foreign, truncated, malformed or
  wrong-kind payload RAISES naming what was wrong, and is never partially
  accepted.

The oracle's expected side comes from ``build_sample_set`` — a DIFFERENT code
path that this PR does not touch — never from a second call to the capability.
That is the §25 non-self-reference rule: the two sides must be independently
derived or the test proves only that the function is deterministic.
