"""TIDMAD's measurement probe batch must preserve its frozen bytes.

V20 PR C2 / D-C2-12, then Step 07 / PR 07c C1 and C2.

Gate 2 Lite-A case c1 was killed at 24.10 GiB host RSS **before the model
was built**, because `load_probe_batch` materialized the whole
2,010,000,000-sample channel before `max_segments` was applied. The bounded
replacement reads only the samples the batch needs — but a loader that is
merely *similar* would silently change what is measured, so until 07c the two
were compared **to each other**.

07c removed the unbounded loader (Q-07c-1) and moved the remaining one onto
the resolved `DatasetProfile`, so the comparison target changed with it: this
module now owns the **Checkpoint-0 byte oracle**, a set of goldens captured by
executing the pre-refactor loader at `GOLDEN_CAPTURED_AT`. Comparing to a
frozen value is strictly stronger than comparing two implementations — two
implementations can drift together, a captured hash cannot.

Everything runs against a small deterministic HDF5 fixture with the production
structure. That is the only way to test this: the real dataset would cost
~13 GiB per invocation, which is the defect.

# 07c replaces the measurement path's three hardcoded TIDMAD facts (channel
# name, `+128` offset, `abra_training_*.h5` family) with values derived from
# the resolved `DatasetProfile`. "The bytes did not move" is the property the
# whole PR rests on, and a baseline captured AFTER the edit proves nothing —
# so the numbers below are frozen here, at the pre-edit base, and every later
# producer is measured against them rather than against another loader.
