"""D14-1 parity: the current implementation vs the FROZEN pre-relocation manifest.

Child design FROZEN rev 2 §5 (C2a) / §6. Two claims, deliberately separate:

1. the committed manifest is BYTE-IMMUTABLE and really was generated at the
   pre-relocation head — the recorded commit predates every relocation
   commit, which is what makes the comparison non-self-referential;
2. the CURRENT implementation reproduces it exactly.

Before C2b, (2) is a determinism proof. From C2b onward it is THE parity
oracle: the expected side comes from the committed artifact, never from a
second runtime call (the #221 self-reference rule, applied).
