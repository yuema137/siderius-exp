"""S2 / U5 — the TIDMAD comparison seeder goes through the recorder.

The defect: the seed used to write ``summary_<run>.json`` directly, putting
a record in the derived VIEW that was in no history. Once the view is a
projection of the canonical log, the tuner's next save rebuilds the view
from the log and the baseline vanishes. Each test states which half of
that it guards.
