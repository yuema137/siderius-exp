"""The X9 GPU-C probe assembler must honour the failure contract it states.

F-Q5-1, found on testpod during the Q5 co-residency probe. All four quad
legs died. The orchestrator DETECTED that correctly and printed its
promise (`gpu_c_coresidency_probe.sh:179-180`):

    WARNING: at least one quad leg failed or timed out — the assembler
      will name the failed legs and exit non-zero (factor not usable).

The assembler then died with `FileNotFoundError` at `_load_leg`, which
opened each leg JSON with no existence handling. The failed legs were
never named. **The detection worked; the reporting did not.**

The invariant, in the form the ledger records it:

    A STATED CONTRACT MUST BE HONOURED ON THE PATH THAT STATES IT.

`assemble` already implemented the promise -- `failed_legs`, the
`FAILED LEGS:` line, `return 1 if failures else 0` -- but only for legs
that survived long enough to write a file. Its failure test was
`status != "success"`, which can only see legs that wrote one, so TOTAL
failure was the single outcome it could not report. That is why the
crash and the blind spot are one defect and not two: the reporter was
unreachable exactly when it was most needed.

Scope. This is the CONTRACT half only. Nothing here reproduces or
explains why four legs died in under a second (hardware, a separate
lane), and nothing here touches the probe's leg-launch behaviour -- there
is a standing order on testpod that the probe script must not be changed
to obtain a green, and these tests are written so that it could not help
if it were: they drive `assemble` over fixture JSONs on disk and never
launch a leg.
