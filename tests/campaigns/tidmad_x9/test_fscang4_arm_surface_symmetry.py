"""X9 F-SCANG-4 — the symmetry gate can see the routes that actually differ.

The frozen row's requirement has three clauses, and each names a route the
argv-only gate was blind to:

    The gate must compare RENDERED PROMPT BYTES between arms, not argv, and
    must cover the environment and the machine-local stores. Otherwise
    section 10 cannot honestly claim arm symmetry was verified.

The gate's two original layers are both argv — a resolved-config JSON and a
child command line, produced by "two HYPOTHETICAL COMMAND LINES on ONE
MACHINE". ``campaign_arm_surface.py`` captures the three missing routes for
one arm; ``campaign_arm_symmetry.check_surfaces`` compares two captures.

Each test names the defect only it catches.

* ``TestStoreDigestPortability`` — the digest of a machine-local store must
  be a function of CONTENT, not of where the store is mounted. If an
  absolute path entered the hash, EVERY cross-pod comparison would be red,
  the operator would switch the layer off, and the row would reopen wearing
  a green check. Discrimination: one changed byte must move the digest.
* ``TestEnvironmentCapture`` — the declared capture rule, asserted by
  positive membership against a synthetic environ carrying decoys. A
  prefix that stopped matching would silently shrink the captured
  population to nothing, and "no environment difference" would then be true
  for free. Secret-shaped names must record presence WITHOUT the value:
  this artifact is copied into a launch packet.
* ``TestSurfaceContract`` — ``build_surface`` refuses an undeclared or
  unresolved store id. A store silently dropped at capture time is a store
  the comparator can never find missing.
* ``TestPromptByteSymmetry`` — clause 1. The NEUTRAL render (both arms at
  ``baseline_isolation=False``) must be byte-identical, because with the
  treatment held constant only machine-local state can move it; the ARM
  render must differ on the declared treatment surfaces, because two arms
  rendering identical prompts are mis-wired, not symmetric. Both directions
  are exercised, plus the missing-surface case that would otherwise let a
  renamed surface shrink what the gate can see.
* ``TestEnvironmentSymmetry`` / ``TestStoreSymmetry`` — clauses 2 and 3,
  each with its legal PASS case (a DECLARED arm-local variable, the
  observed-only calibration store) and its targeted FAIL case. A layer that
  only ever passes is not evidence; a layer that fails on the legitimate
  per-arm GPU assignment would be switched off within a day.
* ``TestDeclaredPolicy`` — the classification tables, hardcoded. Reading
  them back out of the module would compare the policy to itself.
* ``TestTheSurfaceLayerCannotBeSkipped`` — ``--with-surface`` /
  ``--without-surface`` are REQUIRED. Optional would mean a preflight that
  forgot them still prints "arm symmetry holds" from argv alone — precisely
  the claim the row says cannot honestly be made.
* ``TestProductionWitness`` — the reachability evidence. A contaminated
  generated library on ONE arm is captured by the REAL
  ``campaign_arm_surface.py``, reaches the REAL rendered prompt bytes, and
  turns the REAL ``campaign_arm_symmetry.py`` red on both the store row and
  the prompt row. No synthetic dict anywhere in this test.
* ``TestPreflightWiring`` — R7 actually invokes the capture, publishes the
  surface into the shared campaign root (what makes the comparison
  cross-pod) and passes both surfaces to the checker; the arm's isolation
  flag is READ from its own resolved-config print rather than re-derived;
  the evidence caveat is printed in EVERY derived state and an unknown
  state refuses rather than falling silent; and the gold arm still SKIPS
  the whole row, because Gold<->Blind treatment symmetry is a separate
  blind-launch prerequisite this script deliberately does not serve.

N-6 (release blocker) added two more classes, because layer 3 was labelling
evidence it never verified — *the label must not claim more than the
comparison established*:

* ``TestSurfaceAttribution`` — half A. ``published`` was asserted on
  ``[ -f <path> ]`` alone and the artifact carried no captured-at, host or
  revision, so nothing about it could be checked; the honesty disclaimer was
  printed only in the weaker ``local`` state and therefore VANISHED on the
  upgrade. The strength is now derived from the surfaces themselves, and an
  unattributable surface is refused rather than read.
* ``TestLayerScoping`` — half B. ``capture_environment`` and
  ``resolve_stores`` take no arm argument, so on one host the environment,
  the machine-local stores and the neutral prompt render agree BY
  CONSTRUCTION; the row nonetheless reported that they agree. They are now
  reported NOT COMPARED — a named absence, the same rule this codebase
  spells ``inapplicable``. The paired discrimination test proves the scoping
  never SILENCES a difference, only withholds the claim that agreement
  proves something.
* ``TestCrossPodPortability`` — N-9. Two host-local facts were compared as
  content facts: an absolute ``PYTHONPATH`` injected by the preflight
  itself, and ``.pyc`` headers carrying the source mtime. Either would
  false-FAIL R7 between two genuinely different pods, and a gate that
  cannot pass on two real pods gets switched off.

No GPU, no LLM, no training.

        'unstated' silently — the caller falls back to the loud caveat.

        The probe uses the PRODUCTION calling idiom
        (``X="$(fn ...)" || X=""``) deliberately. Calling the function bare
        under ``set -euo pipefail`` makes the non-matching grep abort the
        assignment, so a bare probe reports exit 1 and empty stdout for a
        reason that has nothing to do with the refusal — it passes even when
        the refusal has been replaced by a default. That is exactly a test
        green for the wrong reason, and it was: this assertion only became
        real once the probe matched the call site."""
