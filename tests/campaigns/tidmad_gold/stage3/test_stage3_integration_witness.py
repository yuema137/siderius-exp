"""Stage-3 INTEGRATION WITNESS — the three mechanisms against the REAL composer.

The three Stage-3 writers were built in parallel lanes, each stubbing the
shared ``compose_and_score`` boundary (contract §4). Every per-lane suite is
therefore green even if the lanes disagree about the boundary in practice.
This module is the subtree's one end-to-end witness: ONE synthetic campaign
workspace, all three production CLIs, the REAL ``campaigns.tidmad_gold.stage3.stage3_common``
(resolution, refusals, anchor-ruler pin — no stubs), with exactly ONE patch at
the arithmetic boundary: ``stage3_common.score_vector`` is replaced by a
deterministic counting stub, because the frozen TIDMAD arithmetic needs real
ABRA HDF5 + the committed anchor map's data, which a unit test must not.
Composition, refusal, selection, and isolation logic are all real.

Defects only this witness catches (and how it fails when they break):

* a writer calling the composer in a shape the REAL composer refuses
  (per-lane stubs accept anything; here a wrong pooled set raises
  ``NotScoreableError`` and the mechanism's CLI exits 2, failing the rc
  assertion);
* the composer resolving a pooled set the writers did not intend
  (duplicate/missing file indices across pooled dirs — the call-count and
  per-call 20-distinct-paths assertions go red);
* ``score_vector`` invoked more or fewer than EXACTLY ONCE per composition
  (total-call-count assertion: 1 composed + 4 strict + 1 terminal = 6);
* strict selection ignoring ``MetricOrder`` direction (the planted scalars
  are all NEGATIVE with the winner nearest zero: a lower-is-better or
  ``min``-shaped bug selects rnnD instead of wavenetA);
* a terminal artifact escaping the isolation namespace (every emitted file
  that self-declares the terminal namespace marker must live under it, and
  the terminal writer's own read-closure guard must hold on the REAL final
  tree);
* a per-band scalar appearing in ANY Stage-3 artifact or stdout line
  (independent walker below — not the writers' own guards).

Fixture reuse: the Stage-1 campaign builder is writer C's own
(``test_stage3_composed_best._make_campaign`` — real locks, manifests,
effective health config, eligibility-authority-valid records), and the
Stage-2 tree builder is writer D's (``test_strict_best._build_tree``).
Reusing them keeps this witness from diverging from the per-lane contracts.

Q-S3-2 RULED A (supervisor, 2026-08-26): a unit's ``deliverables/`` carries
its TARGET-BAND files only — DS8's ``--data_scope`` behaviour already
produces exactly that, a design's four band dirs partition 0..19, and
whole-dir pooling composes with zero duplicates. This witness populates
units accordingly, and markers carry the band's file count (validated by
strict_best's marker schema).
