"""Stage-3 Strict Best finalization witnesses (contract PR #329, operator lane D).

Every test drives the REAL production entry points (``finalize_strict_best``
or ``main``) with only the frozen §4 composer boundary stubbed (SRI-2: prove
consumption at the runtime consumer, never a re-implementation), on synthetic
Stage-2 trees under ``tmp_path``. The witnesses, each with its failure mode:

* missing-COMPLETE refusal — a marker-less unit (even with partial content
  present) refuses the WHOLE finalization by name, with zero composer calls;
* healthgate_invalid refusal — the operator negative control: a numerically
  excellent invalid unit is never selectable, its score never echoed;
* one-composed-call-per-design — exactly one full-scope pooled call per
  design, in frozen band order;
* direction-aware selection — including a lower-is-better MetricOrder case;
* SRI-11 pin — an AST census over the production module that goes RED if a
  per-band-mean path (second composer call site, division, sum/mean family,
  local max/min/sorted, or a direction-literal comparison) is added;
* no-band-scalar outputs (coordinator hazard flag, 2026-08-26) — the
  provenance JSON and stdout carry no band-level scalar field.

The sibling module ``scripts/stage3/stage3_common.py`` is owned by a parallel
writer lane and may not exist on this branch; the stubs here honor the frozen
signature, and one test proves the production importlib binding resolves that
exact module path.
