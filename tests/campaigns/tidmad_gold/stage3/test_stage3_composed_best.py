"""Witnesses for the Stage-3 Composed Best writer (contract §1, §3, §4).

Synthetic band-chain workspaces are built through the REAL authorities the
writer consumes — ``materialize_effective_config`` (the pinned effective
Health config), ``write_run_invariants`` (the lock), and
``publish_iteration_manifest`` (the self-digested write-once manifest) — so
these tests certify the production consumption path, not a hand-rolled
parallel format. Only ``score_vector`` is stubbed, at the shared module's
boundary (``stage3_common.score_vector``).

Each test names the defect only it can catch:

* end-to-end: trial/invalid records silently winning the band; the pooled
  set scored more than once; provenance not matching the pooled bytes;
* direction: a ``max()`` re-derivation instead of ``MetricOrder``;
* frozen role identity: ``is_trial`` read as a value instead of the
  contract's absence-of-key rule;
* the no-band-scalar witness (coordinator addendum): a band-level scalar
  appearing anywhere in the provenance JSON or the stdout log;
* verification: consuming a run output whose bytes moved after publication;
* layout: pooling from a workspace whose locked scope is not the band.
