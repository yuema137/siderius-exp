"""Adversarial fixture library for the Stage-3 Gold-campaign contract.

**What this module is.** The INDEPENDENT validator's side of the Stage-3
work. It fabricates contract-conformant Stage-1 / Stage-2 / Stage-3 trees
under a caller-supplied temporary ``workspace_root``, together with the
parameterized CORRUPTIONS the witness tests need, plus the two census
scanners and the two monkeypatch helpers those witnesses run against a
writer's real module.

**Built from the contract alone.** The only specification consulted is
``docs/campaign/stage_artifact_contract.md`` (Lane F, FROZEN). No Stage-3
writer branch and no writer worktree was read while building this, because
a harness that mirrors the implementation it validates cannot catch a
defect the two share.

**Where it is NOT independent — deliberately.** Every fact the contract
delegates to a landed production authority is resolved by CALLING that
authority, never by restating it:

===================================  ====================================
fact                                 authority
===================================  ====================================
deliverable filenames                ``DeliverableNaming`` (``name`` /
                                     ``any_glob`` / ``input_identity_of``)
which gates a valid candidate needs  ``required_blocking_gate_ids``
whether a record is a valid          ``is_valid_candidate``
candidate
gate-result record shape             ``PersistedHealthGateResult``
record / tuner-output shape          ``ExperimentRecord`` /
                                     ``HyperparamTuningOutput``
iteration manifest + self-digest     ``publish_iteration_manifest``
effective Health config + its sha    ``materialize_effective_config``
run-invariants lock                  ``RunInvariants``
metric identity and direction        ``TIDMAD_METRIC_ID`` /
                                     ``MetricIdentityKey`` / ``MetricOrder``
===================================  ====================================

A fixture that hand-rolls ``abra_validation_denoised_{...}.h5`` would pass
against a writer that hand-rolls the same template and fail against one
that correctly asks the authority; that is the exact inversion this table
exists to prevent.

**Known fixture limitations, stated rather than hidden.**

* Deliverables are placeholder bytes carrying the HDF5 magic signature.
  They satisfy "the file exists, is named correctly and sniffs as HDF5";
  they are NOT readable by ``h5py``. Every witness here stubs the scoring
  authority, so no witness opens one. A phase-2 witness that needs a real
  scorer must build real HDF5 instead — see ``DELIVERABLE_PAYLOAD_NOTE``.
* Scores planted here are arbitrary ordering material. They are not
  physically meaningful and must never be quoted as evidence about a model.

**Hard constraint honoured by every artifact this module writes**: no
per-band SCALAR is ever produced. Band names appear in PATHS and as STRING
labels (``target_band: "4-9"``); no artifact maps a band identifier to a
number. ``COMPLETE.json``'s ``denoising_score`` is a UNIT-level scalar,
which contract §2 declares explicitly.

# W3, artifact half — terminal-eval ARTIFACT plants
#
# The source census above answers "does any consumer's CODE name the
# reserved namespace?". It cannot answer "did a terminal artifact reach a
# search-side consumer's INPUT tree?", which is the other half of the
# isolation rule and the half a real leak takes. A production guard for it
# has three possible detection bases, and they do not cover the same cases:
#
#   path resolution   — the artifact's real path lands inside terminal_eval/
#                       (survives a symlink; survives a stripped marker)
#   content marker    — the artifact self-declares its namespace in an
#                       envelope key (survives a copy; NOT a strip)
#   enumeration       — the consumer's input roots are a closed list that
#                       structurally cannot contain the namespace
#
# The plants below are built to separate those three, so a phase-2 result
# says WHICH basis a guard actually has rather than only whether it fired.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Envelope key/value by which a terminal artifact self-declares its
#: namespace. PHASE 2: imported from the production module that emits them
#: (``ARTIFACT_NAMESPACE_KEY`` / ``TERMINAL_NAMESPACE_MARKER``), never
#: restated — a plant built from a restated constant would sail past the
#: real guard while the harness reported it caught.
