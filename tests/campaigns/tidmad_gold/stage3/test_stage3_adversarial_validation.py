"""Adversarial witnesses for the Stage-3 Gold-campaign contract — PHASE 1.

**What phase 1 proves.** Not that the writers are correct — their branches
have deliberately not been read. It proves the HARNESS works: every witness
below is executed against a quarantined reference that implements the
frozen contract semantics and nothing else, so a witness that could never
fire is caught here rather than passing vacuously against real code in
phase 2.

**How phase 2 uses this file.** Two fixtures — ``compose_and_score`` and
``strict_best_finalizer`` — are the only swap points. Phase 2 re-points
them at the landed writer modules and the witnesses run unchanged. The
reference implementations stay, as the harness's own regression proof.

Witness inventory, each with the defect it catches and how it fails:

===  =====================================================================
W0   FROZEN SIGNATURE. Defect: the §4 signature drifts — a renamed
     parameter, a lost keyword-only marker, a changed default. Fails as
     a signature mismatch naming the parameter. Only this catches it,
     because all three writers call the wrapper positionally in the happy
     path and would not notice until the second caller.
W1a  BAND-BOUNDARY MISSING. Defect: ``range(4, 9)`` where ``range(4, 10)``
     was meant, so the 4-9 winner is one file short at the UPPER boundary.
     Fails as "no refusal raised" — or, worse in production, as a silent
     19-file score that looks like a valid campaign number.
W1b  BAND-BOUNDARY DUPLICATE. Defect: an off-by-one band map on the LOWER
     boundary makes file 0004 resolvable from two pools. Fails as "no
     refusal raised", or as a refusal that names only one of the two
     paths, which cannot be debugged.
W1c  FORMAL IDENTITY, BOTH PERSISTED SHAPES. Defect: implementing §1's
     "absence of the is_trial key" literally, when the persisted
     run_output_*.json materializes ``is_trial: false``. Fails as "the
     formal predicate rejected a formal record".
W2a  STRICT_BEST STALE-PARTIAL. Defect: a design quad with 3 markers and 1
     stale partial gets finalized on the surviving three. Fails as "no
     refusal", or as a refusal that does not name the unit, or as a
     nonzero compose call count, or as a selection artifact on disk.
W2b  STRICT_BEST HEALTHGATE-INVALID. Same shape, different cause.
W3   TERMINAL_EVAL READ CLOSURE. Defect: a search/selection consumer gains
     a read of the reserved namespace. Two halves — a SOURCE census and
     an ARTIFACT plant matrix separating the three detection bases. Fails
     as an unflagged plant.
W4   SCORE_VECTOR CALL COUNT. Defect: the wrapper scores per band and
     aggregates, which is the F-SCAND-1 slice-mean the contract refuses.
     Fails as a call count != 1.
W5   NO-BAND-SCALAR CENSUS. Defect: a per-band scalar reaches an output
     artifact. Fails as an unflagged plant; the inverse defect — flagging
     a legal band LABEL — fails as a finding on the clean artifact.

#: carrying the number one level down was allowed through. FIXED pre-merge
