"""The wave record: canonical evidence, derived view, and the order.

V20 PR E, D-E-3 and D-E-3a.

One record goes to two places, so three things have to be true and none
of them is checkable by reading the code:

- the canonical JSONL is written and made durable **first**, so a failure
  between the steps loses the convenience and never the evidence;
- a derived write that fails is reported as *itself*, not as a lost
  record, because "the summary is missing" and "the evidence is missing"
  call for different operator responses;
- a retried wave produces a **different** ``record_id``, so the one
  mutable per-wave file can always be tied back to the append-only
  history it came from.
