"""Executable census over ``docs/campaign/official_campaign_decisions.yaml``.

WHICH DEFECT THIS CATCHES THAT NOTHING ELSE DOES
------------------------------------------------
That file is the FROZEN AUTHORITY a tag-time release-blocker census reads, and
before this module **nothing in the repository parsed it**. Several test modules
mention row ids in their docstrings; none loads the YAML. The census was a human
reading 7,600 lines.

The file has TWO WRITERS on two branches — the release lanes (later on
REMEDIATION) and the campaign-planning lane (later on OPERATOR RULINGS) — and
they diverge bidirectionally. That produces one failure mode no other check in
this repository can see:

    A ROW WHOSE `status` IS STALE ON BOTH BRANCHES AT ONCE.

On 2026-08-27 the four ``F-SCANE-*`` rows read ``PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION`` on
``origin/master`` while their fix WAS ``origin/master``'s own HEAD commit
(``d2c12ebe``, PR #360, which changed 29 files and did not touch this ledger).
The campaign branch read ``PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION`` too. A diff between the two
writers showed nothing, because *two stale copies agree*. Pyright, ruff and
Pydantic see a YAML document they never load; every other test sees Python. The
only thing that could have caught it is an assertion about the CONTENT of the
census, pinned to a set someone has to justify changing — which is this module.

It is not a one-off. Within three merges it happened again: PR #361
(``b012616a``) closed ``F-SCANB-3``, ``F-SCANF-1`` and ``F-SCANF-2`` in code and
left all three reading ``PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION`` here. The pattern is
structural, not careless — the PR that fixes a defect updates code and tests,
and the ledger is written by a separate reconciliation pass, so the window is
open by construction on every single fix. A guard is the only thing that closes
it, because the person best placed to notice is the one who just proved the
code correct and has no reason to open a YAML file.

The consequence runs in both directions and both are release hazards:

* a FALSE OPEN holds a tag for work that already landed;
* a FALSE CLOSED ships a genuine release blocker.

HOW THESE TESTS FAIL WHEN THE BEHAVIOUR BREAKS
----------------------------------------------
* ``test_open_release_blockers_are_exactly_the_declared_set`` — a row moving
  into or out of the open set fails with the two symmetric differences printed
  by id. It is a POSITIVE MEMBERSHIP assertion (``==`` against a named set), not
  ``assert not offenders``: an emptiness assertion passes when the scanner
  silently stops finding anything, which is census blindness shape 2.
* ``test_a_terminal_release_blocker_names_its_evidence`` — flipping a status to
  ``DISCHARGED`` without a SHA, a ruling or a moot reason fails naming the row.
* ``test_fields_carrying_an_open_token_are_classified`` — a NEW field name
  carrying an open-status token fails until it is classified HISTORICAL (what
  the row used to say) or LIVE (a declared open item). Without this the ruled
  historical-field exclusion could silently widen, and the census would change
  meaning with nobody deciding that it should.
* ``test_the_ledger_vocabulary_is_a_subset_of_the_plan`` — the YAML declaring a
  status the plan's §0 does not define fails naming it.
* ``test_every_status_in_use_is_declared`` — a row carrying an undeclared
  status fails naming it. This is the direction a newly INVENTED value takes,
  and the pair is asserted because the two catch opposite drifts.

THE VOCABULARY PAIR, and why it is not ceremony. Measured 2026-08-27: SIX
statuses were carried by rows while declared in neither the plan's §0 nor the
ledger, and ALL FIVE members of this module's then-private terminal set were
undeclared — ``RESOLVED_BY_RULING`` was not even carried by any row. A census
that owns its own closed-side vocabulary cannot be wrong about it, so every
mismatch reads as a ledger bug and the cheapest repair is to edit the census.
The set now has exactly one home (``terminal_statuses`` in the ledger, defined
in plan §0.1) and these two tests make drift a failure rather than a discovery.

Evidence lives in ``~/.siderius_supervisor/AUTHORITY_RECONCILIATION_2026_08_27.md``.

#:
#: THE RULE FOR CHANGING THIS SET. Because it is hardcoded, every merge that
#: closes a blocker moves it, and the temptation is to edit it until the suite
#: is green. Removing an id REQUIRES that the row itself already carry a LANDED
#: SHA — a `reconciled` / `discharge` / `closed_*` field or a `ruling_*` naming
#: the commit — verified against merged source, never against a PR being open
#: or a commit message. `test_a_terminal_release_blocker_names_its_evidence`
#: enforces the SHA half independently, so deleting an id here without
#: evidencing the row leaves the suite red anyway. Adding an id is always
#: allowed: a newly-found blocker is a finding, not a regression in this file.
#: EMPTY again as of 2026-08-27, after `b5b063f3` (PR #374) landed the five
#: blinded-review repairs this set named while they were in flight. Those rows
#: carried `landed_sha: null` until a REAL SHA existed; none was invented.
#:
#: This set has now gone empty → non-empty → empty within one day, and both
#: transitions were caught by this test rather than noticed. That churn is the
#: normal state of a pre-tag ledger, not an anomaly.
#:
#: EMPTY is the strongest state this pin can hold AND the most fragile:
#: `observed == expected` is trivially true when BOTH are empty, including when
#: the scan is broken and examines nothing. `test_the_blocker_census_is_not_
#: vacuous` exists for exactly this state — an all-clear is only meaningful if
#: something was inspected.
